	<h2 class="section_title">PREFACE</h2>

	<p><span class="special_emphasis">The</span> stories contained in this little volume were
	chosen, by virtue of a sort of literary civil-service
	examination, in order that they might be grouped
	together as a representative class of the author&#8217;s
	best-known work in this line.</p>

	<p>Several of these stories have points of peculiar
	interest to the author. For instance, &#8220;Negative
	Gravity&#8221; was composed in Switzerland when
	the author was temporarily confined to the house
	in full view of unreachable Alps.</p>

	<p>&#8220;His Wife&#8217;s Deceased Sister&#8221; was suggested
	by an editorial disposition to compare all the
	author&#8217;s work with one previous production, and
	to discard everything which did not accord exactly
	with the particular story which had been
	selected as a standard of merit.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The Lady, or the Tiger?&#8221; was printed in the
	<a class="pagenum" id="pagevi" title="vi">&nbsp;</a>hope that the author might receive the cheerful
	coöperation of some of his readers in a satisfactory
	solution of the problem contained in the little
	story; but although he has had much valuable
	assistance in this direction he has also been the
	recipient of a great deal of scolding.</p>

	<p>After reading several stories by Clark Russell,
	the author&#8217;s mind was led to consider the possibility
	of inventing some sort of shipwreck which
	had never yet been made the subject of a story.
	His efforts in this line resulted in &#8220;The Remarkable
	Wreck of the &#8216;Thomas Hyke.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A Piece of Red Calico&#8221; is a description, with
	exaggerated points, of an actual experience.</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">My</span> wife and I were staying at a small
	town in northern Italy; and on a certain
	pleasant afternoon in spring we
	had taken a walk of six or seven miles
	to see the sun set behind some low mountains to
	the west of the town. Most of our walk had
	been along a hard, smooth highway, and then we
	turned into a series of narrower roads, sometimes
	bordered by walls, and sometimes by light fences
	of reed or cane. Nearing the mountain, to a low
	spur of which we intended to ascend, we easily
	scaled a wall about four feet high, and found ourselves
	upon pasture-land, which led, sometimes by
	gradual ascents, and sometimes by bits of rough
	climbing, to the spot we wished to reach. We
	were afraid we were a little late, and therefore hurried
	on, running up the grassy hills, and bounding
	briskly over the rough and rocky places. I carried
	a knapsack strapped firmly to my shoulders,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4">&nbsp;</a>and under my wife&#8217;s arm was a large, soft basket
	of a kind much used by tourists. Her arm was
	passed through the handles and around the bottom
	of the basket, which she pressed closely to her
	side. This was the way she always carried it.
	The basket contained two bottles of wine, one
	sweet for my wife, and another a little acid for
	myself. Sweet wines give me a headache.</p>

	<p>When we reached the grassy bluff, well known
	thereabouts to lovers of sunset views, I stepped
	immediately to the edge to gaze upon the scene,
	but my wife sat down to take a sip of wine, for
	she was very thirsty; and then, leaving her basket,
	she came to my side. The scene was indeed one
	of great beauty. Beneath us stretched a wide
	valley of many shades of green, with a little river
	running through it, and red-tiled houses here and
	there. Beyond rose a range of mountains, pink,
	pale green, and purple where their tips caught the
	reflection of the setting sun, and of a rich gray-green
	in shadows. Beyond all was the blue Italian
	sky, illumined by an especially fine sunset.</p>

	<p>My wife and I are Americans, and at the time
	of this story were middle-aged people and very
	fond of seeing in each other&#8217;s company whatever
	there was of interest or beauty around us. We
	had a son about twenty-two years old, of whom
	we were also very fond; but he was not with us,
	being at that time a student in Germany. Although
	we had good health, we were not very robust people,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5">&nbsp;</a>and, under ordinary circumstances, not much
	given to long country tramps. I was of medium
	size, without much muscular development,
	while my wife was quite stout, and growing
	stouter.</p>

	<p>The reader may, perhaps, be somewhat surprised
	that a middle-aged couple, not very strong,
	or very good walkers, the lady loaded with a
	basket containing two bottles of wine and a metal
	drinking-cup, and the gentleman carrying a heavy
	knapsack, filled with all sorts of odds and ends,
	strapped to his shoulders, should set off on a
	seven-mile walk, jump over a wall, run up a hillside,
	and yet feel in very good trim to enjoy a
	sunset view. This peculiar state of things I will
	proceed to explain.</p>

	<p>I had been a professional man, but some years
	before had retired upon a very comfortable income.
	I had always been very fond of scientific pursuits,
	and now made these the occupation and pleasure
	of much of my leisure time. Our home was in
	a small town; and in a corner of my grounds I
	built a laboratory, where I carried on my work
	and my experiments. I had long been anxious to
	discover the means not only of producing, but of
	retaining and controlling, a natural force, really
	the same as centrifugal force, but which I called
	negative gravity. This name I adopted because
	it indicated better than any other the action of
	the force in question, as I produced it. Positive
	<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6">&nbsp;</a>gravity attracts everything toward the centre of the
	earth. Negative gravity, therefore, would be that
	power which repels everything from the centre of
	the earth, just as the negative pole of a magnet
	repels the needle, while the positive pole attracts
	it. My object was, in fact, to store centrifugal
	force and to render it constant, controllable, and
	available for use. The advantages of such a discovery
	could scarcely be described. In a word,
	it would lighten the burdens of the world.</p>

	<p>I will not touch upon the labors and disappointments
	of several years. It is enough to say that
	at last I discovered a method of producing, storing,
	and controlling negative gravity.</p>

	<p>The mechanism of my invention was rather
	complicated, but the method of operating it was
	very simple. A strong metallic case, about eight
	inches long, and half as wide, contained the machinery
	for producing the force; and this was put
	into action by means of the pressure of a screw
	worked from the outside. As soon as this pressure
	was produced, negative gravity began to be
	evolved and stored, and the greater the pressure
	the greater the force. As the screw was moved
	outward, and the pressure diminished, the force
	decreased, and when the screw was withdrawn to
	its fullest extent, the action of negative gravity
	entirely ceased. Thus this force could be produced
	or dissipated at will to such degrees as
	might be desired, and its action, so long as the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7">&nbsp;</a>requisite pressure was maintained, was constant.</p>

	<p>When this little apparatus worked to my satisfaction
	I called my wife into my laboratory and
	explained to her my invention and its value. She
	had known that I had been at work with an important
	object, but I had never told her what it
	was. I had said that if I succeeded I would tell
	her all, but if I failed she need not be troubled
	with the matter at all. Being a very sensible
	woman, this satisfied her perfectly. Now I explained
	everything to her&#8212;the construction of
	the machine, and the wonderful uses to which
	this invention could be applied. I told her that it
	could diminish, or entirely dissipate, the weight
	of objects of any kind. A heavily loaded wagon,
	with two of these instruments fastened to its
	sides, and each screwed to a proper force, would
	be so lifted and supported that it would press
	upon the ground as lightly as an empty cart, and
	a small horse could draw it with ease. A bale of
	cotton, with one of these machines attached,
	could be handled and carried by a boy. A car,
	with a number of these machines, could be made
	to rise in the air like a balloon. Everything, in
	fact, that was heavy could be made light; and as
	a great part of labor, all over the world, is caused
	by the attraction of gravitation, so this repellent
	force, wherever applied, would make weight less
	and work easier. I told her of many, many ways
	<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8">&nbsp;</a>in which the invention might be used, and would
	have told her of many more if she had not suddenly
	burst into tears.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The world has gained something wonderful,&#8221;
	she exclaimed, between her sobs, &#8220;but I have
	lost a husband!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; I asked, in
	surprise.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t minded it so far,&#8221; she said, &#8220;because
	it gave you something to do, and it pleased
	you, and it never interfered with our home pleasures
	and our home life. But now that is all
	over. You will never be your own master again.
	It will succeed, I am sure, and you may make a
	great deal of money, but we don&#8217;t need money.
	What we need is the happiness which we have
	always had until now. Now there will be companies,
	and patents, and lawsuits, and experiments,
	and people calling you a humbug, and
	other people saying they discovered it long ago,
	and all sorts of persons coming to see you, and
	you&#8217;ll be obliged to go to all sorts of places, and
	you will be an altered man, and we shall never be
	happy again. Millions of money will not repay
	us for the happiness we have lost.&#8221;</p>

	<p>These words of my wife struck me with much
	force. Before I had called her my mind had begun
	to be filled and perplexed with ideas of what
	I ought to do now that the great invention was
	perfected. Until now the matter had not troubled
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9">&nbsp;</a>me at all. Sometimes I had gone backward and
	sometimes forward, but, on the whole, I had always
	felt encouraged. I had taken great pleasure
	in the work, but I had never allowed myself to be
	too much absorbed by it. But now everything
	was different. I began to feel that it was due to
	myself and to my fellow-beings that I should
	properly put this invention before the world.
	And how should I set about it? What steps
	should I take? I must make no mistakes. When
	the matter should become known hundreds of
	scientific people might set themselves to work;
	how could I tell but that they might discover
	other methods of producing the same effect? I
	must guard myself against a great many things.
	I must get patents in all parts of the world.
	Already, as I have said, my mind began to be
	troubled and perplexed with these things. A
	turmoil of this sort did not suit my age or disposition.
	I could not but agree with my wife that
	the joys of a quiet and contented life were now
	about to be broken into.</p>

	<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I believe, with you, that
	the thing will do us more harm than good. If it
	were not for depriving the world of the invention
	I would throw the whole thing to the winds.
	And yet,&#8221; I added, regretfully, &#8220;I had expected
	a great deal of personal gratification from the use
	of this invention.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now listen,&#8221; said my wife, eagerly; &#8220;don&#8217;t
	<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10">&nbsp;</a>you think it would be best to do this: use the
	thing as much as you please for your own amusement
	and satisfaction, but let the world wait? It
	has waited a long time, and let it wait a little
	longer. When we are dead let Herbert have the
	invention. He will then be old enough to judge
	for himself whether it will be better to take advantage
	of it for his own profit, or simply to give
	it to the public for nothing. It would be cheating
	him if we were to do the latter, but it would
	also be doing him a great wrong if we were, at his
	age, to load him with such a heavy responsibility.
	Besides, if he took it up, you could not help going
	into it, too.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I took my wife&#8217;s advice. I wrote a careful and
	complete account of the invention, and, sealing it
	up, I gave it to my lawyers to be handed to my
	son after my death. If he died first, I would
	make other arrangements. Then I determined to
	get all the good and fun out of the thing that was
	possible without telling any one anything about it.
	Even Herbert, who was away from home, was not
	to be told of the invention.</p>

	<p>The first thing I did was to buy a strong
	leathern knapsack, and inside of this I fastened
	my little machine, with a screw so arranged that
	it could be worked from the outside. Strapping
	this firmly to my shoulders, my wife gently turned
	the screw at the back until the upward tendency
	of the knapsack began to lift and sustain me.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11">&nbsp;</a>When I felt myself so gently supported and upheld
	that I seemed to weigh about thirty or forty
	pounds, I would set out for a walk. The knapsack
	did not raise me from the ground, but it
	gave me a very buoyant step. It was no labor at
	all to walk; it was a delight, an ecstasy. With
	the strength of a man and the weight of a child, I
	gayly strode along. The first day I walked half
	a dozen miles at a very brisk pace, and came back
	without feeling in the least degree tired. These
	walks now became one of the greatest joys of my
	life. When nobody was looking, I would bound
	over a fence, sometimes just touching it with one
	hand, and sometimes not touching it at all. I delighted
	in rough places. I sprang over streams.
	I jumped and I ran. I felt like Mercury himself.</p>

	<p>I now set about making another machine, so
	that my wife could accompany me in my walks;
	but when it was finished she positively refused
	to use it. &#8220;I can&#8217;t wear a knapsack,&#8221; she said,
	&#8220;and there is no other good way of fastening it
	to me. Besides, everybody about here knows I am
	no walker, and it would only set them talking.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I occasionally made use of this second machine,
	but I will give only one instance of its application.
	Some repairs were needed to the foundation-walls
	of my barn, and a two-horse wagon, loaded with
	building-stone, had been brought into my yard
	and left there. In the evening, when the men
	had gone away, I took my two machines and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12">&nbsp;</a>fastened them, with strong chains, one on each
	side of the loaded wagon. Then, gradually turning
	the screws, the wagon was so lifted that its
	weight became very greatly diminished. We had
	an old donkey which used to belong to Herbert,
	and which was now occasionally used with a
	small cart to bring packages from the station. I
	went into the barn and put the harness on the
	little fellow, and, bringing him out to the wagon,
	I attached him to it. In this position he looked
	very funny with a long pole sticking out in front
	of him and the great wagon behind him. When
	all was ready I touched him up; and, to my great
	delight, he moved off with the two-horse load of
	stone as easily as if he were drawing his own
	cart. I led him out into the public road, along
	which he proceeded without difficulty. He was
	an opinionated little beast, and sometimes stopped,
	not liking the peculiar manner in which he was
	harnessed; but a touch of the switch made him
	move on, and I soon turned him and brought the
	wagon back into the yard. This determined the
	success of my invention in one of its most important
	uses, and with a satisfied heart I put the
	donkey into the stable and went into the house.</p>

	<p>Our trip to Europe was made a few months
	after this, and was mainly on our son Herbert&#8217;s
	account. He, poor fellow, was in great trouble,
	and so, therefore, were we. He had become engaged,
	with our full consent, to a young lady in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13">&nbsp;</a>our town, the daughter of a gentleman whom we
	esteemed very highly. Herbert was young to be
	engaged to be married, but as we felt that he
	would never find a girl to make him so good
	a wife, we were entirely satisfied, especially as it
	was agreed on all hands that the marriage was
	not to take place for some time. It seemed to
	us that, in marrying Janet Gilbert, Herbert would
	secure for himself, in the very beginning of his
	career, the most important element of a happy
	life. But suddenly, without any reason that
	seemed to us justifiable, Mr. Gilbert, the only
	surviving parent of Janet, broke off the match;
	and he and his daughter soon after left the town
	for a trip to the West.</p>

	<p>This blow nearly broke poor Herbert&#8217;s heart.
	He gave up his professional studies and came
	home to us, and for a time we thought he would
	be seriously ill. Then we took him to Europe,
	and after a Continental tour of a month or two
	we left him, at his own request, in Göttingen,
	where he thought it would do him good to go to
	work again. Then we went down to the little
	town in Italy where my story first finds us. My
	wife had suffered much in mind and body on her
	son&#8217;s account, and for this reason I was anxious
	that she should take outdoor exercise, and enjoy
	as much as possible the bracing air of the country.
	I had brought with me both my little machines.
	One was still in my knapsack, and the other I
	<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14">&nbsp;</a>had fastened to the inside of an enormous family
	trunk. As one is obliged to pay for nearly every
	pound of his baggage on the Continent, this saved
	me a great deal of money. Everything heavy was
	packed into this great trunk&#8212;books, papers, the
	bronze, iron, and marble relics we had picked
	up, and all the articles that usually weigh down
	a tourist&#8217;s baggage. I screwed up the negative-gravity
	apparatus until the trunk could be handled
	with great ease by an ordinary porter. I could
	have made it weigh nothing at all, but this, of
	course, I did not wish to do. The lightness of
	my baggage, however, had occasioned some comment,
	and I had overheard remarks which were
	not altogether complimentary about people travelling
	around with empty trunks; but this only
	amused me.</p>

	<p>Desirous that my wife should have the advantage
	of negative gravity while taking our walks, I
	had removed the machine from the trunk and
	fastened it inside of the basket, which she could
	carry under her arm. This assisted her wonderfully.
	When one arm was tired she put the
	basket under the other, and thus, with one hand
	on my arm, she could easily keep up with the
	free and buoyant steps my knapsack enabled me
	to take. She did not object to long tramps here,
	because nobody knew that she was not a walker,
	and she always carried some wine or other refreshment
	in the basket, not only because it was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15">&nbsp;</a>pleasant to have it with us, but because it seemed
	ridiculous to go about carrying an empty basket.</p>

	<p>There were English-speaking people stopping
	at the hotel where we were, but they seemed
	more fond of driving than walking, and none of
	them offered to accompany us on our rambles,
	for which we were very glad. There was one
	man there, however, who was a great walker.
	He was an Englishman, a member of an Alpine
	Club, and generally went about dressed in a
	knickerbocker suit, with gray woollen stockings
	covering an enormous pair of calves. One evening
	this gentleman was talking to me and some
	others about the ascent of the Matterhorn, and I
	took occasion to deliver in pretty strong language
	my opinion upon such exploits. I declared them
	to be useless, foolhardy, and, if the climber had
	any one who loved him, wicked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Even if the weather should permit a view,&#8221; I
	said, &#8220;what is that compared to the terrible risk
	to life? Under certain circumstances,&#8221; I added
	(thinking of a kind of waistcoat I had some idea
	of making, which, set about with little negative-gravity
	machines, all connected with a conveniently
	handled screw, would enable the wearer at
	times to dispense with his weight altogether),
	&#8220;such ascents might be divested of danger, and
	be quite admissible; but ordinarily they should
	be frowned upon by the intelligent public.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The Alpine Club man looked at me, especially
	<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16">&nbsp;</a>regarding my somewhat slight figure and thinnish
	legs.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very well for you to talk that way,&#8221; he
	said, &#8220;because it is easy to see that you are not
	up to that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;In conversations of this kind,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I
	never make personal allusions; but since you
	have chosen to do so, I feel inclined to invite
	you to walk with me to-morrow to the top of the
	mountain to the north of this town.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;at any time you choose
	to name.&#8221; And as I left the room soon afterward
	I heard him laugh.</p>

	<p>The next afternoon, about two o&#8217;clock, the
	Alpine Club man and myself set out for the
	mountain.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What have you got in your knapsack?&#8221; he
	said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A hammer to use if I come across geological
	specimens, a field-glass, a flask of wine, and some
	other things.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t carry any weight, if I were you,&#8221;
	he said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind it,&#8221; I answered, and off we
	started.</p>

	<p>The mountain to which we were bound was
	about two miles from the town. Its nearest side
	was steep, and in places almost precipitous, but
	it sloped away more gradually toward the north,
	and up that side a road led by devious windings
	<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17">&nbsp;</a>to a village near the summit. It was not a very
	high mountain, but it would do for an afternoon&#8217;s
	climb.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I suppose you want to go up by the road,&#8221;
	said my companion.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;we won&#8217;t go so far
	around as that. There is a path up this side,
	along which I have seen men driving their goats.
	I prefer to take that.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;All right, if you say so,&#8221; he answered, with
	a smile; &#8220;but you&#8217;ll find it pretty tough.&#8221;</p>

	<p>After a time he remarked:</p>

	<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t walk so fast, if I were you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I like to step along briskly,&#8221; I said.
	And briskly on we went.</p>

	<p>My wife had screwed up the machine in the
	knapsack more than usual, and walking seemed
	scarcely any effort at all. I carried a long alpenstock,
	and when we reached the mountain and began
	the ascent, I found that with the help of this
	and my knapsack I could go uphill at a wonderful
	rate. My companion had taken the lead, so as to
	show me how to climb. Making a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">détour</em> over
	some rocks, I quickly passed him and went
	ahead. After that it was impossible for him to
	keep up with me. I ran up steep places, I cut
	off the windings of the path by lightly clambering
	over rocks, and even when I followed the beaten
	track my step was as rapid as if I had been walking
	on level ground.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; shouted the Alpine Club man
	from below, &#8220;you&#8217;ll kill yourself if you go at
	that rate! That&#8217;s no way to climb mountains.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my way!&#8221; I cried. And on I skipped.</p>

	<p>Twenty minutes after I arrived at the summit
	my companion joined me, puffing, and wiping his
	red face with his handkerchief.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Confound it!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I never came up a
	mountain so fast in my life.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You need not have hurried,&#8221; I said, coolly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I was afraid something would happen to
	you,&#8221; he growled, &#8220;and I wanted to stop you.
	I never saw a person climb in such an utterly
	absurd way.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you should call it absurd,&#8221; I
	said, smiling with an air of superiority. &#8220;I arrived
	here in a perfectly comfortable condition,
	neither heated nor wearied.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He made no answer, but walked off to a little
	distance, fanning himself with his hat and growling
	words which I did not catch. After a time
	I proposed to descend.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You must be careful as you go down,&#8221; he
	said. &#8220;It is much more dangerous to go down
	steep places than to climb up.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am always prudent,&#8221; I answered, and
	started in advance. I found the descent of the
	mountain much more pleasant than the ascent.
	It was positively exhilarating. I jumped from
	rocks and bluffs eight and ten feet in height, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19">&nbsp;</a>touched the ground as gently as if I had stepped
	down but two feet. I ran down steep paths, and,
	with the aid of my alpenstock, stopped myself in
	an instant. I was careful to avoid dangerous
	places, but the runs and jumps I made were such
	as no man had ever made before upon that mountain-side.
	Once only I heard my companion&#8217;s
	voice.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll break your &#8212;&#8212; neck!&#8221; he yelled.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Never fear!&#8221; I called back, and soon left him
	far above.</p>

	<p>When I reached the bottom I would have
	waited for him, but my activity had warmed me
	up, and as a cool evening breeze was beginning
	to blow I thought it better not to stop and take
	cold. Half an hour after my arrival at the hotel
	I came down to the court, cool, fresh, and dressed
	for dinner, and just in time to meet the Alpine man
	as he entered, hot, dusty, and growling.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Excuse me for not waiting for you,&#8221; I said;
	but without stopping to hear my reason, he muttered
	something about waiting in a place where
	no one would care to stay, and passed into the
	house.</p>

	<p>There was no doubt that what I had done gratified
	my pique and tickled my vanity.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I think now,&#8221; I said, when I related the
	matter to my wife, &#8220;that he will scarcely say
	that I am not up to that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am not sure,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;that it was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20">&nbsp;</a>exactly fair. He did not know how you were
	assisted.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It was fair enough,&#8221; I said. &#8220;He is enabled
	to climb well by the inherited vigor of his
	constitution and by his training. He did not tell
	me what methods of exercise he used to get those
	great muscles upon his legs. I am enabled to
	climb by the exercise of my intellect. My method
	is my business and his method is his business.
	It is all perfectly fair.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Still she persisted:</p>

	<p>&#8220;He <em>thought</em> that you climbed with your legs,
	and not with your head.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And now, after this long digression, necessary
	to explain how a middle-aged couple of slight
	pedestrian ability, and loaded with a heavy knapsack
	and basket, should have started out on a
	rough walk and climb, fourteen miles in all, we
	will return to ourselves, standing on the little
	bluff and gazing out upon the sunset view.
	When the sky began to fade a little we turned
	from it and prepared to go back to the town.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Where is the basket?&#8221; I said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I left it right here,&#8221; answered my wife. &#8220;I
	unscrewed the machine and it lay perfectly flat.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Did you afterward take out the bottles?&#8221; I
	asked, seeing them lying on the grass.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe I did. I had to take out yours
	in order to get at mine.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said I, after looking all about the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21">&nbsp;</a>grassy patch on which we stood, &#8220;I am afraid
	you did not entirely unscrew the instrument, and
	that when the weight of the bottles was removed
	the basket gently rose into the air.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It may be so,&#8221; she said, lugubriously. &#8220;The
	basket was behind me as I drank my wine.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I believe that is just what has happened,&#8221; I
	said. &#8220;Look up there! I vow that is our
	basket!&#8221;</p>

	<p>I pulled out my field-glass and directed it at a
	little speck high above our heads. It was the
	basket floating high in the air. I gave the glass
	to my wife to look, but she did not want to use it.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I can&#8217;t walk
	home without that basket. It&#8217;s perfectly dreadful!&#8221;
	And she looked as if she was going to
	cry.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Do not distress yourself,&#8221; I said, although I
	was a good deal disturbed myself. &#8220;We shall
	get home very well. You shall put your hand
	on my shoulder, while I put my arm around you.
	Then you can screw up my machine a good deal
	higher, and it will support us both. In this way
	I am sure that we shall get on very well.&#8221;</p>

	<p>We carried out this plan, and managed to walk
	on with moderate comfort. To be sure, with the
	knapsack pulling me upward, and the weight of
	my wife pulling me down, the straps hurt me
	somewhat, which they had not done before. We
	did not spring lightly over the wall into the road,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22">&nbsp;</a>but, still clinging to each other, we clambered
	awkwardly over it. The road for the most part
	declined gently toward the town, and with moderate
	ease we made our way along it. But we
	walked much more slowly than we had done before,
	and it was quite dark when we reached our
	hotel. If it had not been for the light inside the
	court it would have been difficult for us to find it.
	A travelling-carriage was standing before the entrance,
	and against the light. It was necessary
	to pass around it, and my wife went first. I attempted
	to follow her, but, strange to say, there
	was nothing under my feet. I stepped vigorously,
	but only wagged my legs in the air. To
	my horror I found that I was rising in the air! I
	soon saw, by the light below me, that I was some
	fifteen feet from the ground. The carriage drove
	away, and in the darkness I was not noticed. Of
	course I knew what had happened. The instrument
	in my knapsack had been screwed up to such
	an intensity, in order to support both myself and
	my wife, that when her weight was removed the
	force of the negative gravity was sufficient to raise
	me from the ground. But I was glad to find that
	when I had risen to the height I have mentioned
	I did not go up any higher, but hung in the air,
	about on a level with the second tier of windows
	of the hotel.</p>

	<p>I now began to try to reach the screw in my
	knapsack in order to reduce the force of the negative
	<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23">&nbsp;</a>gravity; but, do what I would, I could not
	get my hand to it. The machine in the knapsack
	had been placed so as to support me in a well-balanced
	and comfortable way; and in doing this
	it had been impossible to set the screw so that I
	could reach it. But in a temporary arrangement
	of the kind this had not been considered necessary,
	as my wife always turned the screw for me until
	sufficient lifting power had been attained. I had
	intended, as I have said before, to construct a
	negative-gravity waistcoat, in which the screw
	should be in front, and entirely under the wearer&#8217;s
	control; but this was a thing of the future.</p>

	<p>When I found that I could not turn the screw
	I began to be much alarmed. Here I was,
	dangling in the air, without any means of reaching
	the ground. I could not expect my wife to
	return to look for me, as she would naturally
	suppose I had stopped to speak to some one. I
	thought of loosening myself from the knapsack,
	but this would not do, for I should fall heavily,
	and either kill myself or break some of my bones.
	I did not dare to call for assistance, for if any of
	the simple-minded inhabitants of the town had
	discovered me floating in the air they would have
	taken me for a demon, and would probably have
	shot at me. A moderate breeze was blowing, and
	it wafted me gently down the street. If it had
	blown me against a tree I would have seized it,
	and have endeavored, so to speak, to climb down
	<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24">&nbsp;</a>it; but there were no trees. There was a dim
	street-lamp here and there, but reflectors above
	them threw their light upon the pavement, and
	none up to me. On many accounts I was glad
	that the night was so dark, for, much as I desired
	to get down, I wanted no one to see me in my
	strange position, which, to any one but myself
	and wife, would be utterly unaccountable. If I
	could rise as high as the roofs I might get on
	one of them, and, tearing off an armful of tiles,
	so load myself that I would be heavy enough to
	descend. But I did not rise to the eaves of any
	of the houses. If there had been a telegraph-pole,
	or anything of the kind that I could have
	clung to, I would have taken off the knapsack,
	and would have endeavored to scramble down as
	well as I could. But there was nothing I could
	cling to. Even the water-spouts, if I could have
	reached the face of the houses, were embedded in
	the walls. At an open window, near which I was
	slowly blown, I saw two little boys going to bed
	by the light of a dim candle. I was dreadfully
	afraid that they would see me and raise an alarm.
	I actually came so near to the window that I
	threw out one foot and pushed against the wall
	with such force that I went nearly across the
	street. I thought I caught sight of a frightened
	look on the face of one of the boys; but of this I
	am not sure, and I heard no cries. I still floated,
	dangling, down the street. What was to be done?
	<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25">&nbsp;</a>Should I call out? In that case, if I were not
	shot or stoned, my strange predicament, and the
	secret of my invention, would be exposed to the
	world. If I did not do this, I must either let myself
	drop and be killed or mangled, or hang there
	and die. When, during the course of the night,
	the air became more rarefied, I might rise higher
	and higher, perhaps to an altitude of one or two
	hundred feet. It would then be impossible for
	the people to reach me and get me down, even if
	they were convinced that I was not a demon. I
	should then expire, and when the birds of the air
	had eaten all of me that they could devour, I
	should forever hang above the unlucky town, a
	dangling skeleton with a knapsack on its back.</p>

	<p>Such thoughts were not reassuring, and I determined
	that if I could find no means of getting
	down without assistance, I would call out and
	run all risks; but so long as I could endure the
	tension of the straps I would hold out, and hope
	for a tree or a pole. Perhaps it might rain, and
	my wet clothes would then become so heavy that
	I would descend as low as the top of a lamp-post.</p>

	<p>As this thought was passing through my mind
	I saw a spark of light upon the street approaching
	me. I rightly imagined that it came from a
	tobacco-pipe, and presently I heard a voice. It
	was that of the Alpine Club man. Of all people
	in the world I did not want him to discover me,
	and I hung as motionless as possible. The man
	<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26">&nbsp;</a>was speaking to another person who was walking
	with him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;He is crazy beyond a doubt,&#8221; said the Alpine
	man. &#8220;Nobody but a maniac could have gone up
	and down that mountain as he did! He hasn&#8217;t
	any muscles, and one need only look at him to
	know that he couldn&#8217;t do any climbing in a natural
	way. It is only the excitement of insanity
	that gives him strength.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The two now stopped almost under me, and
	the speaker continued:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Such things are very common with maniacs.
	At times they acquire an unnatural strength which
	is perfectly wonderful. I have seen a little fellow
	struggle and fight so that four strong men could
	not hold him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then the other person spoke.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am afraid what you say is too true,&#8221; he remarked.
	&#8220;Indeed, I have known it for some time.&#8221;</p>

	<p>At these words my breath almost stopped. It
	was the voice of Mr. Gilbert, my townsman, and
	the father of Janet. It must have been he who
	had arrived in the travelling-carriage. He was acquainted
	with the Alpine Club man, and they were
	talking of me. Proper or improper, I listened
	with all my ears.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is a very sad case,&#8221; Mr. Gilbert continued.
	&#8220;My daughter was engaged to marry his son,
	but I broke off the match. I could not have her
	marry the son of a lunatic, and there could be no
	<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27">&nbsp;</a>doubt of his condition. He has been seen&#8212;a
	man of his age, and the head of a family&#8212;to
	load himself up with a heavy knapsack, which
	there was no earthly necessity for him to carry,
	and go skipping along the road for miles, vaulting
	over fences and jumping over rocks and ditches
	like a young calf or a colt. I myself saw a most
	heartrending instance of how a kindly man&#8217;s nature
	can be changed by the derangement of his
	intellect. I was at some distance from his house,
	but I plainly saw him harness a little donkey
	which he owns to a large two-horse wagon loaded
	with stone, and beat and lash the poor little beast
	until it drew the heavy load some distance along
	the public road. I would have remonstrated with
	him on this horrible cruelty, but he had the wagon
	back in his yard before I could reach him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, there can be no doubt of his insanity,&#8221;
	said the Alpine Club man, &#8220;and he oughtn&#8217;t to be
	allowed to travel about in this way. Some day he
	will pitch his wife over a precipice just for the fun
	of seeing her shoot through the air.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am sorry he is here,&#8221; said Mr. Gilbert,
	&#8220;for it would be very painful to meet him. My
	daughter and I will retire very soon, and go
	away as early to-morrow morning as possible, so
	as to avoid seeing him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And then they walked back to the hotel.</p>

	<p>For a few moments I hung, utterly forgetful of
	my condition, and absorbed in the consideration
	<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28">&nbsp;</a>of these revelations. One idea now filled my
	mind. Everything must be explained to Mr.
	Gilbert, even if it should be necessary to have
	him called to me, and for me to speak to him
	from the upper air.</p>

	<p>Just then I saw something white approaching
	me along the road. My eyes had become accustomed
	to the darkness, and I perceived that it was
	an upturned face. I recognized the hurried gait,
	the form; it was my wife. As she came near
	me, I called her name, and in the same breath
	entreated her not to scream. It must have been
	an effort for her to restrain herself, but she did it.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You must help me to get down,&#8221; I said,
	&#8220;without anybody seeing us.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; she whispered.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Try to catch hold of this string.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Taking a piece of twine from my pocket, I lowered
	one end to her. But it was too short; she
	could not reach it. I then tied my handkerchief
	to it, but still it was not long enough.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I can get more string, or handkerchiefs,&#8221; she
	whispered, hurriedly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said; &#8220;you could not get them up to
	me. But, leaning against the hotel wall, on this
	side, in the corner, just inside of the garden gate,
	are some fishing-poles. I have seen them there
	every day. You can easily find them in the dark.
	Go, please, and bring me one of those.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The hotel was not far away, and in a few minutes
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29">&nbsp;</a>my wife returned with a fishing-pole. She
	stood on tiptoe, and reached it high in air; but
	all she could do was to strike my feet and legs
	with it. My most frantic exertions did not enable
	me to get my hands low enough to touch it.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; she said; and the rod was
	withdrawn.</p>

	<p>I knew what she was doing. There was a
	hook and line attached to the pole, and with
	womanly dexterity she was fastening the hook to
	the extreme end of the rod. Soon she reached
	up, and gently struck at my legs. After a few
	attempts the hook caught in my trousers, a little
	below my right knee. Then there was a slight
	pull, a long scratch down my leg, and the hook
	was stopped by the top of my boot. Then came
	a steady downward pull, and I felt myself descending.
	Gently and firmly the rod was drawn
	down; carefully the lower end was kept free from
	the ground; and in a few moments my ankle was
	seized with a vigorous grasp. Then some one
	seemed to climb up me, my feet touched the
	ground, an arm was thrown around my neck, the
	hand of another arm was busy at the back of my
	knapsack, and I soon stood firmly in the road,
	entirely divested of negative gravity.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh that I should have forgotten,&#8221; sobbed
	my wife, &#8220;and that I should have dropped your
	arms and let you go up into the air! At first I
	thought that you had stopped below, and it was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30">&nbsp;</a>only a little while ago that the truth flashed upon
	me. Then I rushed out and began looking up for
	you. I knew that you had wax matches in your
	pocket, and hoped that you would keep on striking
	them, so that you would be seen.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But I did not wish to be seen,&#8221; I said, as we
	hurried to the hotel; &#8220;and I can never be sufficiently
	thankful that it was you who found me and
	brought me down. Do you know that it is Mr.
	Gilbert and his daughter who have just arrived?
	I must see him instantly. I will explain it all to
	you when I come upstairs.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I took off my knapsack and gave it to my wife,
	who carried it to our room, while I went to look
	for Mr. Gilbert. Fortunately I found him just
	as he was about to go up to his chamber. He
	took my offered hand, but looked at me sadly and
	gravely.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mr. Gilbert,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I must speak to you
	in private. Let us step into this room. There
	is no one here.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; said Mr. Gilbert, &#8220;it will be
	much better to avoid discussing this subject. It
	is very painful to both of us, and no good can
	come from talking of it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You cannot now comprehend what it is I
	want to say to you,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;Come in here,
	and in a few minutes you will be very glad that
	you listened to me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>My manner was so earnest and impressive that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31">&nbsp;</a>Mr. Gilbert was constrained to follow me, and we
	went into a small room called the smoking-room,
	but in which people seldom smoked, and closed
	the door. I immediately began my statement. I
	told my old friend that I had discovered, by
	means that I need not explain at present, that he
	had considered me crazy, and that now the most
	important object of my life was to set myself right
	in his eyes. I thereupon gave him the whole
	history of my invention, and explained the reason
	of the actions that had appeared to him those of a
	lunatic. I said nothing about the little incident
	of that evening. That was a mere accident, and
	I did not care now to speak of it.</p>

	<p>Mr. Gilbert listened to me very attentively.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Your wife is here?&#8221; he asked, when I had
	finished.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said; &#8220;and she will corroborate my
	story in every item, and no one could ever suspect
	her of being crazy. I will go and bring her
	to you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>In a few minutes my wife was in the room, had
	shaken hands with Mr. Gilbert, and had been told
	of my suspected madness. She turned pale, but
	smiled.</p>

	<p>&#8220;He did act like a crazy man,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but
	I never supposed that anybody would think him
	one.&#8221; And tears came into her eyes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And now, my dear,&#8221; said I, &#8220;perhaps you
	will tell Mr. Gilbert how I did all this.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32">&nbsp;</a>And then she told him the story that I had told.</p>

	<p>Mr. Gilbert looked from the one to the other
	of us with a troubled air.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course I do not doubt either of you, or
	rather I do not doubt that you believe what you
	say. All would be right if I could bring myself
	to credit that such a force as that you speak of
	can possibly exist.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That is a matter,&#8221; said I, &#8220;which I can easily
	prove to you by actual demonstration. If you
	can wait a short time, until my wife and I have
	had something to eat&#8212;for I am nearly famished,
	and I am sure she must be&#8212;I will set your mind
	at rest upon that point.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will wait here,&#8221; said Mr. Gilbert, &#8220;and
	smoke a cigar. Don&#8217;t hurry yourselves. I shall
	be glad to have some time to think about what
	you have told me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When we had finished the dinner, which had
	been set aside for us, I went upstairs and got my
	knapsack, and we both joined Mr. Gilbert in the
	smoking-room. I showed him the little machine,
	and explained, very briefly, the principle of its
	construction. I did not give any practical demonstration
	of its action, because there were people
	walking about the corridor who might at any
	moment come into the room; but, looking out
	of the window, I saw that the night was much
	clearer. The wind had dissipated the clouds,
	and the stars were shining brightly.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;If you will come up the street with me,&#8221; said
	I to Mr. Gilbert, &#8220;I will show you how this thing
	works.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That is just what I want to see,&#8221; he answered.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will go with you,&#8221; said my wife, throwing
	a shawl over her head. And we started up the
	street.</p>

	<p>When we were outside the little town I found
	the starlight was quite sufficient for my purpose.
	The white roadway, the low walls, and objects
	about us, could easily be distinguished.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said I to Mr. Gilbert, &#8220;I want to put
	this knapsack on you, and let you see how it
	feels, and how it will help you to walk.&#8221; To
	this he assented with some eagerness, and I
	strapped it firmly on him. &#8220;I will now turn
	this screw,&#8221; said I, &#8220;until you shall become
	lighter and lighter.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Be very careful not to turn it too much,&#8221; said
	my wife, earnestly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, you may depend on me for that,&#8221; said
	I, turning the screw very gradually.</p>

	<p>Mr. Gilbert was a stout man, and I was obliged
	to give the screw a good many turns.</p>

	<p>&#8220;There seems to be considerable hoist in it,&#8221;
	he said, directly. And then I put my arms around
	him, and found that I could raise him from the
	ground.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Are you lifting me?&#8221; he exclaimed, in surprise.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Yes; I did it with ease,&#8221; I answered.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Upon&#8212;my&#8212;word!&#8221; ejaculated Mr. Gilbert.</p>

	<p>I then gave the screw a half-turn more, and
	told him to walk and run. He started off, at
	first slowly, then he made long strides, then he
	began to run, and then to skip and jump. It had
	been many years since Mr. Gilbert had skipped
	and jumped. No one was in sight, and he was
	free to gambol as much as he pleased. &#8220;Could
	you give it another turn?&#8221; said he, bounding up
	to me. &#8220;I want to try that wall.&#8221; I put on a
	little more negative gravity, and he vaulted over
	a five-foot wall with great ease. In an instant he
	had leaped back into the road, and in two bounds
	was at my side. &#8220;I came down as light as a
	cat,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There was never anything like
	it.&#8221; And away he went up the road, taking steps
	at least eight feet long, leaving my wife and me
	laughing heartily at the preternatural agility of
	our stout friend. In a few minutes he was with
	us again. &#8220;Take it off,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I wear
	it any longer I shall want one myself, and then I
	shall be taken for a crazy man, and perhaps
	clapped into an asylum.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said I, as I turned back the screw before
	unstrapping the knapsack, &#8220;do you understand
	how I took long walks, and leaped and
	jumped; how I ran uphill and downhill, and
	how the little donkey drew the loaded wagon?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;I understand it all,&#8221; cried he. &#8220;I take back
	all I ever said or thought about you, my friend.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And Herbert may marry Janet?&#8221; cried my wife.</p>

	<p>&#8220;<em>May</em> marry her!&#8221; cried Mr. Gilbert. &#8220;Indeed,
	he <em>shall</em> marry her, if I have anything to
	say about it! My poor girl has been drooping
	ever since I told her it could not be.&#8221;</p>

	<p>My wife rushed at him, but whether she embraced
	him or only shook his hands I cannot say;
	for I had the knapsack in one hand and was rubbing
	my eyes with the other.</p>

	<p>&#8220;But, my dear fellow,&#8221; said Mr. Gilbert,
	directly, &#8220;if you still consider it to your interest
	to keep your invention a secret, I wish you had
	never made it. No one having a machine like
	that can help using it, and it is often quite as bad
	to be considered a maniac as to be one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; I cried, with some excitement,
	&#8220;I have made up my mind on this subject. The
	little machine in this knapsack, which is the only
	one I now possess, has been a great pleasure to
	me. But I now know it has also been of the
	greatest injury indirectly to me and mine, not to
	mention some direct inconvenience and danger,
	which I will speak of another time. The secret
	lies with us three, and we will keep it. But the
	invention itself is too full of temptation and danger
	for any of us.&#8221;</p>

	<p>As I said this I held the knapsack with one
	hand while I quickly turned the screw with the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36">&nbsp;</a>other. In a few moments it was high above my
	head, while I with difficulty held it down by the
	straps. &#8220;Look!&#8221; I cried. And then I released
	my hold, and the knapsack shot into the air and
	disappeared into the upper gloom.</p>

	<p>I was about to make a remark, but had no
	chance, for my wife threw herself upon my bosom,
	sobbing with joy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so glad&#8212;so glad!&#8221; she said.
	&#8220;And you will never make another?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Never another!&#8221; I answered.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And now let us hurry in and see Janet,&#8221; said
	my wife.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know how heavy and clumsy I
	feel,&#8221; said Mr. Gilbert, striving to keep up with
	us as we walked back. &#8220;If I had worn that
	thing much longer, I should never have been
	willing to take it off!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Janet had retired, but my wife went up to her
	room.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I think she has felt it as much as our boy,&#8221;
	she said, when she rejoined me. &#8220;But I tell
	you, my dear, I left a very happy girl in that
	little bedchamber over the garden.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And there were three very happy elderly people
	talking together until quite late that evening. &#8220;I
	shall write to Herbert to-night,&#8221; I said, when we
	separated, &#8220;and tell him to meet us all in Geneva.
	It will do the young man no harm if we interrupt
	his studies just now.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;You must let me add a postscript to the
	letter,&#8221; said Mr. Gilbert, &#8220;and I am sure it will
	require no knapsack with a screw in the back to
	bring him quickly to us.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And it did not.</p>

	<p>There is a wonderful pleasure in tripping over
	the earth like a winged Mercury, and in feeling
	one&#8217;s self relieved of much of that attraction of
	gravitation which drags us down to earth and
	gradually makes the movement of our bodies but
	weariness and labor. But this pleasure is not to
	be compared, I think, to that given by the buoyancy
	and lightness of two young and loving hearts,
	reunited after a separation which they had supposed
	would last forever.</p>

	<p>What became of the basket and the knapsack,
	or whether they ever met in upper air, I do not
	know. If they but float away and stay away from
	ken of mortal man, I shall be satisfied.</p>

	<p>And whether or not the world will ever know
	more of the power of negative gravity depends
	entirely upon the disposition of my son Herbert,
	when&#8212;after a good many years, I hope&#8212;he shall
	open the packet my lawyers have in keeping.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">[<strong class="special_emphasis">Note.</strong>&#8212;It would be quite useless for any one
	to interview my wife on this subject, for she has
	entirely forgotten how my machine was made.
	And as for Mr. Gilbert, he never knew.]</p>

	<h2 class="story_title"><a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41">&nbsp;</a>ASAPH</h2>

	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">About</span> a hundred feet back from the
	main street of a village in New Jersey
	there stood a very good white house.
	Half-way between it and the sidewalk
	was a large chestnut-tree, which had been the
	pride of Mr. Himes, who built the house, and
	was now the pride of Mrs. Himes, his widow,
	who lived there.</p>

	<p>Under the tree was a bench, and on the bench
	were two elderly men, both smoking pipes, and
	each one of them leaning forward with his elbows
	on his knees. One of these, Thomas Rooper by
	name, was a small man with gray side-whiskers,
	a rather thin face, and very good clothes. His
	pipe was a meerschaum, handsomely colored,
	with a long amber tip. He had bought that pipe
	while on a visit to Philadelphia during the great
	Centennial Exposition; and if any one noticed it
	and happened to remark what a fine pipe it was,
	that person would be likely to receive a detailed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42">&nbsp;</a>account of the circumstances of its purchase, with
	an appendix relating to the Main Building, the
	Art Building, the Agricultural Building, and many
	other salient points of the great Exposition which
	commemorated the centennial of our national
	independence.</p>

	<p>The other man, Asaph Scantle, was of a different
	type. He was a little older than his companion,
	but if his hair were gray, it did not show
	very much, as his rather long locks were of a
	sandy hue and his full face was clean shaven, at
	least on Wednesdays and Sundays. He was tall,
	round-shouldered, and his clothes were not good,
	possessing very evident claims to a position on
	the retired list. His pipe consisted of a common
	clay bowl with a long reed stem.</p>

	<p>For some minutes the two men continued to
	puff together as if they were playing a duet upon
	tobacco-pipes, and then Asaph, removing his reed
	from his lips, remarked, &#8220;What you ought to do,
	Thomas, is to marry money.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s sense in that,&#8221; replied the other;
	&#8220;but you wasn&#8217;t the first to think of it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph, who knew very well that Mr. Rooper
	never allowed any one to suppose that he received
	suggestions from without, took no notice of the
	last remark, but went on: &#8220;Lookin&#8217; at the matter
	in a friendly way, it seems to me it stands to reason
	that when the shingles on a man&#8217;s house is so rotten
	that the rain comes through into every room
	<a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43">&nbsp;</a>on the top floor, and when the plaster on the
	ceilin&#8217; is tumblin&#8217; down more or less all the time,
	and the window-sashes is all loose, and things
	generally in a condition that he can&#8217;t let that
	house without spendin&#8217; at least a year&#8217;s rent on it
	to git it into decent order, and when a man&#8217;s got
	to the time of life&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; the matter with the time of
	life,&#8221; said Thomas; &#8220;that&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What I was goin&#8217; to say was,&#8221; continued
	Asaph, &#8220;that when a man gits to the time of life
	when he knows what it is to be comfortable in his
	mind as well as his body&#8212;and that time comes to
	sensible people as soon as they git fairly growed
	up&#8212;he don&#8217;t want to give up his good room in
	the tavern and all the privileges of the house, and
	go to live on his own property and have the
	plaster come down on his own head and the rain
	come down on the coverlet of his own bed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, he don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Thomas; &#8220;and what is
	more, he isn&#8217;t goin&#8217; to do it. But what I git
	from the rent of that house is what I have to live
	on; there&#8217;s no gittin&#8217; around that pint.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Asaph, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t marry
	money, what are you goin&#8217; to do? You can&#8217;t go
	back to your old business.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I never had but one business,&#8221; said Thomas.
	&#8220;I lived with my folks until I was a good deal
	more than growed up; and when the war broke
	out I went as sutler to the rigiment from this
	<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44">&nbsp;</a>place; and all the money I made I put into my
	property in the village here. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve
	lived on ever since. There&#8217;s no more war, so
	there&#8217;s no more sutlers, except away out West
	where I wouldn&#8217;t go; and there are no more
	folks, for they are all dead; and if what Mrs.
	McJimsey says is true, there&#8217;ll be no more tenants
	in my house after the 1st of next November.
	For when the McJimseys go on account of want of
	general repairs, it is not to be expected that anybody
	else will come there. There&#8217;s nobody in this
	place that can stand as much as the McJimseys can.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Consequently,&#8221; said Asaph, deliberately filling
	his pipe, &#8220;it stands to reason that there ain&#8217;t
	nothin&#8217; for you to do but marry money.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thomas Rooper took his pipe from his mouth
	and sat up straight. Gazing steadfastly at his
	companion, he remarked, &#8220;If you think that is
	such a good thing to do, why don&#8217;t you do it
	yourself? There can&#8217;t be anybody much harder
	up than you are.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;The law&#8217;s agin&#8217; my doin&#8217; it,&#8221; said Asaph.
	&#8220;A man can&#8217;t marry his sister.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Are you thinkin&#8217; of Marietta Himes?&#8221; asked
	Mr. Rooper.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the one I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; of,&#8221; said Asaph.
	&#8220;If you can think of anybody better, I&#8217;d like you
	to mention her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Mr. Rooper did not immediately speak. He
	presently asked, &#8220;What do you call money?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Asaph, with a little hesitation,
	&#8220;considerin&#8217; the circumstances, I should say that
	in a case like this about fifteen hundred a year, a
	first-rate house with not a loose shingle on it nor
	a crack anywhere, a good garden and an orchard,
	two cows, a piece of meadow-land on the other
	side of the creek, and all the clothes a woman
	need have, is money.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thomas shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;Clothes!&#8221;
	he said. &#8220;If she marries she&#8217;ll go out of black,
	and then she&#8217;ll have to have new ones, and <ins id="ins1" class="correction" title="lot's">lots</ins>
	of &#8217;em. That would make a big hole in her
	money, Asaph.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The other smiled. &#8220;I always knowed you was
	a far-seein&#8217; feller, Thomas; but it stands to reason
	that Marietta&#8217;s got a lot of clothes that was on
	hand before she went into mournin&#8217;, and she&#8217;s
	not the kind of woman to waste &#8217;em. She&#8217;ll be
	twistin&#8217; &#8217;em about and makin&#8217; &#8217;em over to suit
	the fashions, and it won&#8217;t be like her to be buyin&#8217;
	new colored goods when she&#8217;s got plenty of &#8217;em
	already.&#8221;</p>

	<p>There was now another pause in the conversation,
	and then Mr. Rooper remarked, &#8220;Mrs.
	Himes must be gettin&#8217; on pretty well in years.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not a young woman,&#8221; said Asaph; &#8220;but
	if she was much younger she wouldn&#8217;t have you,
	and if she was much older you wouldn&#8217;t have
	her. So it strikes me she&#8217;s just about the right
	pint.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;How old was John Himes when he died?&#8221;
	asked Thomas.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly know that; but he was a lot
	older than Marietta.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thomas shook his head. &#8220;It strikes me,&#8221;
	said he, &#8220;that John Himes had a hearty constitution
	and hadn&#8217;t ought to died as soon as he did.
	He fell away a good deal in the last years of his
	life.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And considerin&#8217; that he died of consumption,
	he had a right to fall away,&#8221; said Asaph. &#8220;If
	what you are drivin&#8217; at, Thomas, is that Marietta
	isn&#8217;t a good housekeeper and hasn&#8217;t the right sort
	of notions of feedin&#8217;, look at me. I&#8217;ve lived with
	Marietta just about a year, and in that time I have
	gained forty-two pounds. Now, of course, I ain&#8217;t
	unreasonable, and don&#8217;t mean to say that you
	would gain forty-two pounds in a year, &#8216;cause you
	ain&#8217;t got the frame and bone to put it on; but it
	wouldn&#8217;t surprise me a bit if you was to gain
	twenty, or even twenty-five, pounds in eighteen
	months, anyway; and more than that you ought
	not to ask, Thomas, considerin&#8217; your height and
	general build.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Marietta Himes a good deal of a freethinker?&#8221;
	asked Thomas.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221; cried Asaph. &#8220;You mean an infidel?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Thomas, &#8220;I don&#8217;t charge nobody
	with nothin&#8217; more than there&#8217;s reason for; but
	<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47">&nbsp;</a>they do say that she goes sometimes to one church
	and sometimes to another, and that if there was
	a Catholic church in this village she would go to
	that. And who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to say where a woman
	will turn up when she don&#8217;t know her own mind
	better than that?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph colored a little. &#8220;The place where
	Marietta will turn up,&#8221; said he, warmly, &#8220;is on
	a front seat in the kingdom of heaven; and if the
	people that talk about her will mend their ways,
	they&#8217;ll see that I am right. You need not trouble
	yourself about that, Thomas. Marietta Himes is
	pious to the heel.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Mr. Rooper now shifted himself a little on the
	bench and crossed one leg over the other. &#8220;Now
	look here, Asaph,&#8221; he said, with a little more animation
	than he had yet shown, &#8220;supposin&#8217; all
	you say is true, have you got any reason to think
	that Mrs. Himes ain&#8217;t satisfied with things as they
	are?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I have,&#8221; said Asaph. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t
	mind tellin&#8217; you that the thing she&#8217;s least satisfied
	with is me. She wants a man in the house; that
	is nateral. She wouldn&#8217;t be Marietta Himes
	if she didn&#8217;t. When I come to live with her I
	thought the whole business was settled; but it
	isn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t suit her. I don&#8217;t say she&#8217;s lookin&#8217;
	for another man, but if another man was to come
	along, and if he was the right kind of a man, it&#8217;s
	my opinion she&#8217;s ready for him. I wouldn&#8217;t say
	<a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48">&nbsp;</a>this to everybody, but I say it to you, Thomas
	Rooper, &#8216;cause I know what kind of a man you are.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Mr. Rooper did not return the compliment.
	&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder your sister ain&#8217;t satisfied with
	you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for you go ahead of all the lazy
	men I ever saw yet. They was sayin&#8217; down at
	the tavern yesterday&#8212;only yesterday&#8212;that you
	could do less work in more time than anybody
	they ever saw before.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s two ways of workin&#8217;,&#8221; said Asaph.
	&#8220;Some people work with their hands and some
	with their heads.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thomas grimly smiled. &#8220;It strikes me,&#8221; said
	he, &#8220;that the most head-work you do is with your
	jaws.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph was not the man to take offence readily,
	especially when he considered it against his interest
	to do so, and he showed no resentment at this
	remark. &#8220;&#8216;Tain&#8217;t so much my not makin&#8217; myself
	more generally useful,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that Marietta
	objects to; though, of course, it could not be
	expected that a man that hasn&#8217;t got any interest
	in property would keep workin&#8217; at it like a man
	that has got an interest in it, such as Marietta&#8217;s
	husband would have; but it&#8217;s my general appearance
	that she don&#8217;t like. She&#8217;s told me more than
	once she didn&#8217;t so much mind my bein&#8217; lazy as
	lookin&#8217; lazy.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder she thinks that way,&#8221; said
	Thomas. &#8220;But look here, Asaph, do you suppose
	<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49">&nbsp;</a>that if Marietta Himes was to marry a man,
	he would really come into her property?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t nobody that knows my sister better
	than I know her, and I can say, without any
	fear of bein&#8217; contradicted, that when she gives
	herself to a man the good-will and fixtures will be
	included.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thomas Rooper now leaned forward with his
	elbows on his knees without smoking, and Asaph
	Scantle leaned forward with his elbows on his
	knees without smoking. And thus they remained,
	saying nothing to each other, for the space of some
	ten minutes.</p>

	<p>Asaph was a man who truly used his head a
	great deal more than he used his hands. He
	had always been a shiftless fellow, but he was no
	fool, and this his sister found out soon after she
	asked him to come and make his home with her.
	She had not done this because she wanted a man
	in the house, for she had lived two or three years
	without that convenience and had not felt the
	need of it. But she heard that Asaph was in
	very uncomfortable circumstances, and she had
	sent for him solely for his own good. The arrangement
	proved to be a very good one for her
	brother, but not a good one for her. She had
	always known that Asaph&#8217;s head was his main
	dependence, but she was just beginning to discover
	that he liked to use his head so that other
	people&#8217;s hands should work for him.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t nobody comin&#8217; to see your sister,
	is there?&#8221; asked Thomas, suddenly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Not a livin&#8217; soul,&#8221; said Asaph, &#8220;except
	women, married folk, and children. But it has
	always surprised me that nobody did come; but
	just at this minute the field&#8217;s clear and the gate&#8217;s
	open.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Rooper, &#8220;I&#8217;ll think about it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Asaph, rubbing his knees
	with his hands. &#8220;That&#8217;s right. But now tell
	me, Thomas Rooper, supposin&#8217; you get Marietta,
	what are you goin&#8217; to do for me?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;For you?&#8221; exclaimed the other. &#8220;What
	have you got to do with it?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A good deal,&#8221; said Asaph. &#8220;If you get
	Marietta with her fifteen hundred a year&#8212;and it
	wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if it was eighteen hundred&#8212;and
	her house and her garden and her cattle
	and her field and her furniture, with not a leg
	loose nor a scratch, you will get her because I
	proposed her to you, and because I backed you
	up afterward. And now, then, I want to know
	what you are goin&#8217; to do for me?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; asked Thomas.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The first thing I want,&#8221; said Asaph, &#8220;is a
	suit of clothes. These clothes is disgraceful.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You are right there,&#8221; said Mr. Rooper. &#8220;I
	wonder your sister lets you come around in front
	of the house. But what do you mean by clothes&#8212;winter
	clothes or summer clothes?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Winter,&#8221; said Asaph, without hesitation. &#8220;I
	don&#8217;t count summer clothes. And when I say a
	suit of clothes, I mean shoes and hat and underclothes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Mr. Rooper gave a sniff. &#8220;I wonder you
	don&#8217;t say overcoat,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I do say overcoat,&#8221; replied Asaph. &#8220;A suit
	of winter clothes is a suit of clothes that you can go
	out into the weather in without missin&#8217; nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Mr. Rooper smiled sarcastically. &#8220;Is there
	anything else you want?&#8221; he asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Asaph, decidedly; &#8220;there is. I
	want a umbrella.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Cotton or silk?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph hesitated. He had never had a silk
	umbrella in his hand in his life. He was afraid
	to strike too high, and he answered, &#8220;I want a
	good stout gingham.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Mr. Rooper nodded his head. &#8220;Very good,&#8221;
	he said. &#8220;And is that all?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Asaph, &#8220;it ain&#8217;t all. There is one
	more thing I want, and that is a dictionary.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The other man rose to his feet. &#8220;Upon my
	word,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I never before saw a man
	that would sell his sister for a dictionary! And
	what you want with a dictionary is past my conceivin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, it ain&#8217;t past mine,&#8221; said Asaph. &#8220;For
	more than ten years I have wanted a dictionary.
	If I had a dictionary I could make use of my head
	<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52">&nbsp;</a>in a way that I can&#8217;t now. There is books in this
	house, but amongst &#8217;em there is no dictionary. If
	there had been one I&#8217;d been a different man by
	this time from what I am now, and like as not
	Marietta wouldn&#8217;t have wanted any other man in
	the house but me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Mr. Rooper stood looking upon the ground;
	and Asaph, who had also arisen, waited for him
	to speak. &#8220;You are a graspin&#8217; man, Asaph,&#8221;
	said Thomas. &#8220;But there is another thing I&#8217;d
	like to know: if I give you them clothes, you
	don&#8217;t want them before she&#8217;s married?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; said Asaph. &#8220;If I come to the
	weddin&#8217;, I can&#8217;t wear these things. I have got to
	have them first.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Mr. Rooper gave his head a little twist.
	&#8220;There&#8217;s many a slip &#8216;twixt the cup and the
	lip,&#8221; said he.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Asaph; &#8220;and there&#8217;s different
	cups and different lips. But what&#8217;s more, if I
	was to be best man&#8212;which would be nateral,
	considerin&#8217; I&#8217;m your friend and her brother&#8212;you
	wouldn&#8217;t want me standin&#8217; up in this rig. And
	that&#8217;s puttin&#8217; it in your own point of view,
	Thomas.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It strikes me,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;that I could
	get a best man that would furnish his own
	clothes; but we will see about that. There&#8217;s
	another thing, Asaph,&#8221; he said, abruptly; &#8220;what
	are Mrs. Himes&#8217;s views concernin&#8217; pipes?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53">&nbsp;</a>This question startled and frightened Asaph.
	He knew that his sister could not abide the smell
	of tobacco and that Mr. Rooper was an inveterate
	smoker.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That depends,&#8221; said he, &#8220;on the kind of
	tobacco. I don&#8217;t mind sayin&#8217; that Marietta isn&#8217;t
	partial to the kind of tobacco I smoke. But I
	ain&#8217;t a moneyed man and I can&#8217;t afford to buy
	nothin&#8217; but cheap stuff. But when it comes to a
	meerschaum pipe and the very finest Virginia
	or North Carolina smoking-tobacco, such as a
	moneyed man would be likely to use&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>At this moment there came from the house the
	sound of a woman&#8217;s voice, not loud, but clear and
	distinct, and it said &#8220;Asaph.&#8221;</p>

	<p>This word sent through Mr. Rooper a gentle
	thrill such as he did not remember ever having
	felt before. There seemed to be in it a suggestion,
	a sort of prophecy, of what appeared to him
	as an undefined and chaotic bliss. He was not a
	fanciful man, but he could not help imagining
	himself standing alone under that chestnut-tree
	and that voice calling &#8220;Thomas.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Upon Asaph the effect was different. The interruption
	was an agreeable one in one way, because
	it cut short his attempted explanation of the
	tobacco question; but in another way he knew
	that it meant the swinging of an axe, and that
	was not pleasant.</p>

	<p>Mr. Rooper walked back to the tavern in a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54">&nbsp;</a>cogitative state of mind. &#8220;That Asaph Scantle,&#8221;
	he said to himself, &#8220;has got a head-piece, there&#8217;s
	no denying it. If it had not been for him I do
	not believe I should have thought of his sister;
	at least not until the McJimseys had left my
	house, and then it might have been too late.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Marietta Himes was a woman with a gentle
	voice and an appearance and demeanor indicative
	of a general softness of disposition; but beneath
	this mild exterior there was a great deal of firmness
	of purpose. Asaph had not seen very much
	of his sister since she had grown up and married;
	and when he came to live with her he thought
	that he was going to have things pretty much his
	own way. But it was not long before he entirely
	changed his mind.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Himes was of moderate height, pleasant
	countenance, and a figure inclined to plumpness.
	Her dark hair, in which there was not a line of
	gray, was brushed down smoothly on each side
	of her face, and her dress, while plain, was extremely
	neat. In fact, everything in the house
	and on the place was extremely neat, except
	Asaph.</p>

	<p>She was in the bright little dining-room which
	looked out on the flower-garden, preparing the
	table for supper, placing every plate, dish, glass,
	and cup with as much care and exactness as if a
	civil engineer had drawn a plan on the table-cloth
	with places marked for the position of each article.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55">&nbsp;</a>As she finished her work by placing a chair on
	each side of the table, a quiet smile, the result of
	a train of thought in which she had been indulging
	for the past half-hour, stole over her face.
	She passed through the kitchen, with a glance at
	the stove to see if the tea-kettle had begun to
	boil; and going out of the back door, she walked
	over to the shed where her brother was splitting
	kindling-wood.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Asaph,&#8221; said Mrs. Himes, &#8220;if I were to give
	you a good suit of clothes, would you promise
	me that you would never smoke when wearing
	them?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Her brother looked at her in amazement.
	&#8220;Clothes!&#8221; he repeated.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mr. Himes was about your size,&#8221; said his
	sister, &#8220;and he left a good many clothes, which
	are most of them very good and carefully packed
	away, so that I am sure there is not a moth-hole
	in any one of them. I have several times thought,
	Asaph, that I might give you some of his clothes;
	but it did seem to me a desecration to have the
	clothes of such a man, who was so particular and
	nice, filled and saturated with horrible tobacco-smoke,
	which he detested. But now you are
	getting to be so awful shabby, I do not see how
	I can stand it any longer. But one thing I will
	not do&#8212;I will not have Mr. Himes&#8217;s clothes
	smelling of tobacco as yours do; and not only
	your own tobacco, but Mr. Rooper&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Asaph, &#8220;that you are not
	exactly right just there. What you smell about
	me is my smoke. Thomas Rooper never uses
	anything but the finest-scented and delicatest
	brands. I think that if you come to get used to
	his tobacco-smoke you would like it. But as to
	my takin&#8217; off my clothes and puttin&#8217; on a different
	suit every time I want to light my pipe, that&#8217;s
	pretty hard lines, it seems to me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It would be a good deal easier to give up the
	pipe,&#8221; said his sister.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will do that,&#8221; said Asaph, &#8220;when you
	give up tea. But you know as well as I do that
	there&#8217;s no use of either of us a-tryin&#8217; to change
	our comfortable habits at our time of life.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I kept on hoping,&#8221; said Mrs. Himes, &#8220;that
	you would feel yourself that you were not fit to
	be seen by decent people, and that you would go
	to work and earn at least enough money to buy
	yourself some clothes. But as you don&#8217;t seem
	inclined to do that, I thought I would make you
	this offer. But you must understand that I will
	not have you smoke in Mr. Himes&#8217;s clothes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph stood thinking, the head of his axe resting
	upon the ground, a position which suited him.
	He was in a little perplexity. Marietta&#8217;s proposition
	seemed to interfere somewhat with the one he
	had made to Thomas Rooper. Here was a state
	of affairs which required most careful consideration.
	&#8220;I&#8217;ve been arrangin&#8217; about some clothes,&#8221;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57">&nbsp;</a>he said, presently; &#8220;for I know very well I
	need &#8217;em; but I don&#8217;t know just yet how it will
	turn out.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I hope, Asaph,&#8221; said Marietta, quickly, &#8220;that
	you are not thinking of going into debt for clothing,
	and I know that you haven&#8217;t been working
	to earn money. What arrangements have you
	been making?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my private affair,&#8221; said Asaph, &#8220;but
	there&#8217;s no debt in it. It is all fair and square&#8212;cash
	down, so to speak; though, of course, it&#8217;s
	not cash, but work. But, as I said before, that
	isn&#8217;t settled.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am afraid, Asaph,&#8221; said his sister, &#8220;that if
	you have to do the work first you will never get
	the clothes, and so you might as well come back
	to my offer.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph came back to it and thought about it
	very earnestly. If by any chance he could get
	two suits of clothes, he would then feel that he
	had a head worth having. &#8220;What would you
	say,&#8221; he said, presently, &#8220;if when I wanted to
	smoke I was to put on a long duster&#8212;I guess
	Mr. Himes had dusters&#8212;and a nightcap and
	rubbers? I&#8217;d agree to hang the duster and the
	cap in the shed here and never smoke without
	putting &#8217;em on.&#8221; There was a deep purpose in
	this proposition, for, enveloped in the long duster,
	he might sit with Thomas Rooper under the chestnut-tree
	and smoke and talk and plan as long as
	<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58">&nbsp;</a>he pleased, and his companion would not know
	that he did not need a new suit of clothes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Mrs. Himes; &#8220;you must
	make up your mind to act perfectly fairly, Asaph,
	or else say you will not accept my offer. But if
	you don&#8217;t accept it, I can&#8217;t see how you can keep
	on living with me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What do you mean by clothes, Marietta?&#8221;
	he asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I mean a complete suit, of course,&#8221;
	said she.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Winter or summer?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that,&#8221; Mrs. Himes replied;
	&#8220;but that can be as you choose.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Overcoat?&#8221; asked Asaph.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and cane and umbrella, if
	you like, and pocket-handkerchiefs, too. I will
	fit you out completely, and shall be glad to have
	you looking like a decent man.&#8221;</p>

	<p>At the mention of the umbrella another line of
	perplexity showed itself upon Asaph&#8217;s brow. The
	idea came to him that if she would add a dictionary
	he would strike a bargain. Thomas Rooper
	was certainly a very undecided and uncertain sort
	of man. But then there came up the thought of
	his pipe, and he was all at sea again. Giving up
	smoking was almost the same as giving up eating.
	&#8220;Marietta,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I will think about this.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;but it&#8217;s my
	opinion, Asaph, that you ought not to take more
	<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59">&nbsp;</a>than one minute to think about it. However, I
	will give you until to-morrow morning, and then
	if you decide that you don&#8217;t care to look like a
	respectable citizen, I must have some further talk
	with you about our future arrangements.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Make it to-morrow night,&#8221; said Asaph. And
	his sister consented.</p>

	<p>The next day Asaph was unusually brisk and
	active; and very soon after breakfast he walked
	over to the village tavern to see Mr. Rooper.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; exclaimed that individual, surprised
	at his visitor&#8217;s early appearance at the business
	centre of the village. &#8220;What&#8217;s started you out?
	Have you come after them clothes?&#8221;</p>

	<p>A happy thought struck Asaph. He had made
	this visit with the intention of feeling his way toward
	some decision on the important subject of
	his sister&#8217;s proposition, and here a way seemed
	to be opened to him. &#8220;Thomas,&#8221; said he, taking
	his friend aside, &#8220;I am in an awful fix. Marietta
	can&#8217;t stand my clothes any longer. If she can&#8217;t
	stand them she can&#8217;t stand me, and when it comes
	to that, you can see for yourself that I can&#8217;t help
	you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>A shade settled upon Mr. Rooper&#8217;s face. During
	the past evening he had been thinking and
	puffing, and puffing and thinking, until everybody
	else in the tavern had gone to bed; and he had
	finally made up his mind that, if he could do it,
	he would marry Marietta Himes. He had never
	<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60">&nbsp;</a>been very intimate with her or her husband, but
	he had been to meals in the house, and he remembered
	the fragrant coffee and the light, puffy,
	well-baked rolls made by Marietta&#8217;s own hands;
	and he thought of the many differences between
	living in that very good house with that gentle,
	pleasant-voiced lady and his present life in the
	village tavern.</p>

	<p>And so, having determined that without delay
	he would, with the advice and assistance of Asaph,
	begin his courtship, it was natural that he should
	feel a shock of discouragement when he heard
	Asaph&#8217;s announcement that his sister could not
	endure him in the house any longer. To attack
	that house and its owner without the friendly
	offices upon which he depended was an undertaking
	for which he was not at all prepared.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder at her,&#8221; he said, sharply&#8212;&#8220;not
	a bit. But this puts a mighty different face
	on the thing what we talked about yesterday.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It needn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Asaph, quietly. &#8220;The
	clothes you was goin&#8217; to give me wouldn&#8217;t cost a
	cent more to-day than they would in a couple of
	months, say; and when I&#8217;ve got &#8217;em on Marietta
	will be glad to have me around. Everything can
	go on just as we bargained for.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thomas shook his head. &#8220;That would be a
	mighty resky piece of business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
	would be all right, but that&#8217;s not sayin&#8217; that I
	would; for it strikes me that your sister is
	<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61">&nbsp;</a>about as much a bird in the bush as any flyin&#8217;
	critter.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph smiled. &#8220;If the bush was in the middle
	of a field,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and there was only one
	boy after the bird, it would be a pretty tough job.
	But if the bush is in the corner of two high walls,
	and there&#8217;s two boys, and one of &#8217;em&#8217;s got a fishnet
	what he can throw clean over the bush, why,
	then the chances is a good deal better. But
	droppin&#8217; figgers, Thomas, and speakin&#8217; plain and
	straightforward, as I always do&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;About things you want to git,&#8221; interrupted
	Thomas.</p>

	<p>&#8220;&#8212;about everything,&#8221; resumed Asaph. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
	just tell you this: if I don&#8217;t git decent clothes
	now to-day, or perhaps to-morrow, I have got to
	travel out of Marietta&#8217;s house. I can do it and
	she knows it. I can go back to Drummondville
	and git my board for keepin&#8217; books in the store,
	and nobody there cares what sort of clothes I
	wear. But when that happens, your chance of
	gittin&#8217; Marietta goes up higher than a kite.&#8221;</p>

	<p>To the mind of Mr. Rooper this was most conclusive
	reasoning; but he would not admit it and
	he did not like it. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t your sister give
	you clothes?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Old Himes must have
	left some.&#8221;</p>

	<p>A thin chill like a needleful of frozen thread ran
	down Asaph&#8217;s back. &#8220;Mr. Himes&#8217;s clothes!&#8221; he
	exclaimed. &#8220;What in the world are you talkin&#8217;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62">&nbsp;</a>about, Thomas Rooper? &#8216;Tain&#8217;t likely he had
	many, &#8216;cept what he was buried in; and what&#8217;s left,
	if there is any, Marietta would no more think of
	givin&#8217; away than she would of hangin&#8217; up his
	funeral wreath for the canary-bird to perch on.
	There&#8217;s a room up in the garret where she keeps
	his special things&#8212;for she&#8217;s awful particular&#8212;and
	if there is any of his clothes up there I expect
	she&#8217;s got &#8217;em framed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;If she thinks as much of him as that,&#8221; muttered
	Mr. Rooper.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t git any sech ideas as them into your
	head, Thomas,&#8221; said Asaph, quickly. &#8220;Marietta
	ain&#8217;t a woman to rake up the past, and you never
	need be afraid of her rakin&#8217; up Mr. Himes. All
	of the premises will be hern and yourn except that
	room in the garret, and it ain&#8217;t likely she&#8217;ll ever
	ask you to go in there.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;The Lord knows I don&#8217;t want to!&#8221; ejaculated
	Mr. Rooper.</p>

	<p>The two men walked slowly to the end of a
	line of well-used, or, rather, badly used, wooden
	arm-chairs which stood upon the tavern piazza,
	and seated themselves. Mr. Rooper&#8217;s mind was
	in a highly perturbed condition. If he accepted
	Asaph&#8217;s present proposition he would have to
	make a considerable outlay with a very shadowy
	prospect of return.</p>

	<p>&#8220;If you haven&#8217;t got the ready money for the
	clothes,&#8221; said Asaph, after having given his companion
	<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63">&nbsp;</a>some minutes for silent consideration,
	&#8220;there ain&#8217;t a man in this village what they
	would trust sooner at the store for clothes,&#8221; and
	then after a pause he added, &#8220;or books, which,
	of course, they can order from town.&#8221;</p>

	<p>At this Mr. Rooper simply shrugged his shoulders.
	The question of ready money or credit did
	not trouble him.</p>

	<p>At this moment a man in a low phaeton, drawn
	by a stout gray horse, passed the tavern.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Asaph, who knew everybody
	in the village.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Doctor Wicker,&#8221; said Thomas. &#8220;He
	lives over at Timberley. He &#8216;tended John Himes
	in his last sickness.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t practise here, does he?&#8221; said Asaph.
	&#8220;I never see him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No; but he was called in to consult.&#8221; And
	then the speaker dropped again into cogitation.</p>

	<p>After a few minutes Asaph rose. He knew that
	Thomas Rooper had a slow-working mind, and
	thought it would be well to leave him to himself
	for a while. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go home,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and &#8216;tend
	to my chores, and by the time you feel like comin&#8217;
	up and takin&#8217; a smoke with me under the chestnut-tree,
	I reckon you will have made up your mind,
	and we&#8217;ll settle this thing. Fer if I have got to go
	back to Drummondville, I s&#8217;pose I&#8217;ll have to pack
	up this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d say pack off instead of pack up,&#8221; remarked
	<a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64">&nbsp;</a>the other, &#8220;you&#8217;d come nearer the facts,
	considerin&#8217; the amount of your personal property.
	But I&#8217;ll be up there in an hour or two.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When Asaph came within sight of his sister&#8217;s
	house he was amazed to see a phaeton and a gray
	horse standing in front of the gate. From this it
	was easy to infer that the doctor was in the house.
	What on earth could have happened? Was anything
	the matter with Marietta? And if so, why
	did she send for a physician who lived at a distance,
	instead of Doctor McIlvaine, the village
	doctor? In a very anxious state of mind Asaph
	reached the gate, and irresolutely went into the
	yard. His impulse was to go to the house and
	see what had happened; but he hesitated. He
	felt that Marietta might object to having a comparative
	stranger know that such an exceedingly
	shabby fellow was her brother. And, besides, his
	sister could not have been overtaken by any sudden
	illness. She had always appeared perfectly
	well, and there would have been no time during
	his brief absence from the house to send over to
	Timberley for a doctor.</p>

	<p>So he sat down under the chestnut-tree to consider
	this strange condition of affairs. &#8220;Whatever
	it is,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;it&#8217;s nothin&#8217; suddint,
	and it&#8217;s bound to be chronic, and that&#8217;ll skeer
	Thomas. I wish I hadn&#8217;t asked him to come up
	here. The best thing for me to do will be to pretend
	that I have been sent to git somethin&#8217; at the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65">&nbsp;</a>store, and go straight back and keep him from
	comin&#8217; up.&#8221;</p>

	<p>But Asaph was a good deal quicker to think
	than to move, and he still sat with brows wrinkled
	and mind beset by doubts. For a moment he
	thought that it might be well to accept Marietta&#8217;s
	proposition and let Thomas go; but then he remembered
	the conditions, and he shut his mental
	eyes at the prospect.</p>

	<p>At that moment the gate opened and in walked
	Thomas Rooper. He had made up his mind and
	had come to say so; but the sight of the phaeton
	and gray horse caused him to postpone his intended
	announcement. &#8220;What&#8217;s Doctor Wicker
	doin&#8217; here?&#8221; he asked, abruptly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Dunno,&#8221; said Asaph, as carelessly as he could
	speak. &#8220;I don&#8217;t meddle with household matters
	of that kind. I expect it&#8217;s somethin&#8217; the matter
	with that gal Betsey, that Marietta hires to help
	her. She&#8217;s always wrong some way or other so
	that she can&#8217;t do her own proper work, which I
	know, havin&#8217; to do a good deal of it myself. I
	expect it&#8217;s rickets, like as not. Gals do have that
	sort of thing, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Never had anything to do with sick gals,&#8221;
	said Thomas, &#8220;or sick people of any sort, and
	don&#8217;t want to. But it must be somethin&#8217; pretty
	deep-seated for your sister to send all the way to
	Timberley for a doctor.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph knew very well that Mrs. Himes was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66">&nbsp;</a>too economical a person to think of doing such a
	thing as that, and he knew also that Betsey was
	as good a specimen of rustic health as could be
	found in the county. And therefore his companion&#8217;s
	statement that he wanted to have nothing
	to do with sick people had for him a saddening
	import.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I settled that business of yourn,&#8221; said Mr.
	Rooper, &#8220;pretty soon after you left me. I thought
	I might as well come straight around and tell you
	about it. I&#8217;ll make you a fair and square offer.
	I&#8217;ll give you them clothes, though it strikes me
	that winter goods will be pretty heavy for this time
	of year; but it will be on this condition: if I don&#8217;t
	get Marietta, you have got to give &#8217;em back.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph smiled.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I know what you are grinnin&#8217; at,&#8221; said
	Thomas; &#8220;but you needn&#8217;t think that you are
	goin&#8217; to have the wearin&#8217; of them clothes for two
	or three months and then give &#8217;em back. I don&#8217;t
	go in for any long courtships. What I do in that
	line will be short and sharp.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;How short?&#8221; asked Asaph.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, this is Thursday,&#8221; replied the other,
	&#8220;and I calculate to ask her on Monday.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph looked at his companion in amazement.
	&#8220;By George!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;that won&#8217;t work.
	Why, it took Marietta more&#8217;n five days to make
	up her mind whether she would have the chicken-house
	painted green or red, and you can&#8217;t expect
	<a class="pagenum" id="page67" title="67">&nbsp;</a>her to be quicker than that in takin&#8217; a new husband.
	She&#8217;d say No just as certain as she would
	now if you was to go in and ask her right before
	the doctor and Betsey. And I&#8217;ll just tell you
	plain that it wouldn&#8217;t pay me to do all the hustlin&#8217;
	around and talkin&#8217; and argyin&#8217; and recommendin&#8217;
	that I&#8217;d have to do just for the pleasure of wearin&#8217;
	a suit of warm clothes for four July days. I tell
	you what it is, it won&#8217;t do to spring that sort of
	thing on a woman, especially when she&#8217;s what you
	might call a trained widder. You got to give
	&#8217;em time to think over the matter and to look up
	your references. There&#8217;s no use talkin&#8217; about it;
	you must give &#8217;em time, especially when the offer
	comes from a person that nobody but me has ever
	thought of as a marryin&#8217; man.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said Thomas. &#8220;That&#8217;s all you
	know about it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Facts is facts, and you can&#8217;t git around &#8217;em.
	There isn&#8217;t a woman in this village what wouldn&#8217;t
	take at least two weeks to git it into her head
	that you was really courtin&#8217; her. She would be
	just as likely to think that you was tryin&#8217; to git a
	tenant in place of the McJimseys. But a month
	of your courtin&#8217; and a month of my workin&#8217; would
	just about make the matter all right with Marietta,
	and then you could sail in and settle it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Mr. Rooper, rising suddenly.
	&#8220;I will court your sister for one month;
	and if, on the 17th day of August, she takes me,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68">&nbsp;</a>you can go up to the store and git them clothes;
	but you can&#8217;t do it one minute afore. Good-mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph, left alone, heaved a sigh. He did not
	despair; but truly, fate was heaping a great many
	obstacles in his path. He thought it was a very
	hard thing for a man to get his rights in this
	world.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Himes sat on one end of a black hair-covered
	sofa in the parlor, and Doctor Wicker
	sat on a black hair-covered chair opposite to her
	and not far away. The blinds of the window
	opening upon the garden were drawn up; but
	those on the front window, which commanded a
	view of the chestnut-tree, were down. Doctor
	Wicker had just made a proposal of marriage to
	Mrs. Himes, and at that moment they were both
	sitting in silence.</p>

	<p>The doctor, a bluff, hearty-looking man of about
	forty-five, had been very favorably impressed by
	Mrs. Himes when he first made her acquaintance,
	during her husband&#8217;s sickness, and since that time
	he had seen her occasionally and had thought about
	her a great deal. Latterly letters had passed between
	them, and now he had come to make his
	declaration in person.</p>

	<p>It was true, as her brother had said, that Marietta
	was not quick in making up her mind. But
	in this case she was able to act more promptly
	than usual, because she had in a great measure
	<a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69">&nbsp;</a>settled this matter before the arrival of the doctor.
	She knew he was going to propose, and she was
	very much inclined to accept him. This it was
	which had made her smile when she was setting
	the table the afternoon before, and this it was
	which had prompted her to make her proposition
	to her brother in regard to his better personal
	appearance.</p>

	<p>But now she was in a condition of nervous
	trepidation, and made no answer. The doctor
	thought this was natural enough under the circumstances,
	but he had no idea of the cause of it.
	The cause of it was sitting under the chestnut-tree,
	the bright sunlight, streaming through a break in
	the branches above, illuminating and emphasizing
	and exaggerating his extreme shabbiness. The
	doctor had never seen Asaph, and it would have
	been a great shock to Marietta&#8217;s self-respect to
	have him see her brother in his present aspect.</p>

	<p>Through a crack in the blind of the front window
	she had seen Asaph come in and sit down, and
	she had seen Mr. Rooper arrive and had noticed
	his departure. And now, with an anxiety which
	made her chin tremble, she sat and hoped that
	Asaph would get up and go away. For she knew
	that if she should say to the doctor what she was
	perfectly willing to say then and there, he would
	very soon depart, being a man of practical mind
	and pressing business; and that, going to the front
	door with him, she would be obliged to introduce
	<a class="pagenum" id="page70" title="70">&nbsp;</a>him to a prospective brother-in-law whose appearance,
	she truly believed, would make him sick.
	For the doctor was a man, she well knew, who
	was quite as nice and particular about dress and
	personal appearance as the late Mr. Himes had
	been.</p>

	<p>Doctor Wicker, aware that the lady&#8217;s perturbation
	was increasing instead of diminishing, thought
	it wise not to press the matter at this moment.
	He felt that he had been, perhaps, a little over-prompt
	in making his proposition. &#8220;Madam,&#8221;
	said he, rising, &#8220;I will not ask you to give me
	an answer now. I will go away and let you think
	about it, and will come again to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Through the crack in the window-blind Marietta
	saw that Asaph was still under the tree. What
	could she do to delay the doctor? She did not
	offer to take leave of him, but stood looking upon
	the floor. It seemed a shame to make so good a
	man go all the way back to Timberley and come
	again next day, just because that ragged, dirty
	Asaph was sitting under the chestnut-tree.</p>

	<p>The doctor moved toward the door, and as she
	followed him she glanced once more through the
	crack in the window-blind, and, to her intense
	delight, she saw Asaph jump up from the bench
	and run around to the side of the house. He
	had heard the doctor&#8217;s footsteps in the hallway
	and had not wished to meet him. The unsatisfactory
	condition of his outward appearance had
	<a class="pagenum" id="page71" title="71">&nbsp;</a>been so strongly impressed upon him of late that
	he had become a little sensitive in regard to it
	when strangers were concerned. But if he had
	only known that his exceedingly unattractive garments
	had prevented his sister from making a compact
	which would have totally ruined his plans in
	regard to her matrimonial disposition and his own
	advantage, he would have felt for those old clothes
	the respect and gratitude with which a Roman
	soldier regarded the shield and sword which had
	won him a battle.</p>

	<p>Down the middle of the garden, at the back of
	the house, there ran a path, and along this path
	Asaph walked meditatively, with his hands in his
	trousers pockets. It was a discouraging place
	for him to walk, for the beds on each side of him
	were full of weeds, which he had intended to pull
	out as soon as he should find time for the work,
	but which had now grown so tall and strong that
	they could not be rooted up without injuring the
	plants, which were the legitimate occupants of the
	garden.</p>

	<p>Asaph did not know it, but at this moment
	there was not one person in the whole world who
	thought kindly of him. His sister was so mortified
	by him that she was in tears in the house.
	His crony, Thomas, had gone away almost angry
	with him, and even Betsey, whom he had falsely
	accused of rickets, and who had often shown a
	pity for him simply because he looked so forlorn,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72">&nbsp;</a>had steeled her heart against him that morning
	when she found he had gone away without providing
	her with any fuel for the kitchen fire.</p>

	<p>But he had not made a dozen turns up and down
	the path before he became aware of the feeling of
	Marietta. She looked out of the back door and
	then walked rapidly toward him. &#8220;Asaph,&#8221; said
	she, &#8220;I hope you are considering what I said to
	you yesterday, for I mean to stick to my word.
	If you don&#8217;t choose to accept my offer, I want
	you to go back to Drummondville early to-morrow
	morning. And I don&#8217;t feel in the least as if
	I were turning you out of the house, for I have
	given you a chance to stay here, and have only
	asked you to act like a decent Christian. I will
	not have you here disgracing my home. When
	Doctor Wicker came to-day, and I looked out
	and saw you with that miserable little coat with
	the sleeves half-way up to the elbows and great
	holes in it which you will not let anybody patch
	because you are too proud to wear patches, and
	those wretched faded trousers, out at the knees,
	and which have been turned up and hemmed at
	the bottom so often that they are six inches above
	your shoes, and your whole scarecrow appearance,
	I was so ashamed of you that I could not keep
	the tears out of my eyes. To tell a respectable
	gentleman like Doctor Wicker that you were my
	brother was more than I could bear; and I was
	glad when I saw you get up and sneak out of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73">&nbsp;</a>way. I hate to talk to you in this way, Asaph,
	but you have brought it on yourself.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Her brother looked at her a moment. &#8220;Do
	you want me to go away before breakfast?&#8221; he
	said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Marietta, &#8220;but immediately
	afterward.&#8221; And in her mind she resolved that
	breakfast should be very early the next morning.</p>

	<p>If Asaph had any idea of yielding, he did not
	intend to show it until the last moment, and so he
	changed the subject. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with
	Betsey?&#8221; said he. &#8220;If she&#8217;s out of health you&#8217;d
	better get rid of her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing the matter with Betsey,&#8221;
	answered his sister. &#8220;Doctor Wicker came to
	see me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Came to see you!&#8221; exclaimed her brother.
	&#8220;What in the world did he do that for? You
	never told me that you were ailin&#8217;. Is it that
	sprain in your ankle?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Marietta. &#8220;I had almost
	recovered from that sprain when you came here.
	There&#8217;s nothing the matter with my ankle; the
	trouble is probably with my heart.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The moment she said this she regretted it, for
	Asaph had so good a head, and could catch meanings
	so quickly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to hear that, Marietta,&#8221; said Asaph.
	&#8220;That&#8217;s a good deal more serious.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page74" title="74">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said she. And she turned and went
	back to the house.</p>

	<p>Asaph continued to walk up and down the path.
	He had not done a stroke of work that morning,
	but he did not think of that. His sister&#8217;s communication
	saddened him. He liked Marietta,
	and it grieved him to hear that she had anything
	the matter with her heart. He knew that that
	often happened to people who looked perfectly
	well, and there was no reason why he should
	have suspected any disorder in her. Of course,
	in this case, there was good reason for her sending
	for the very best doctor to be had. It was
	all plain enough to him now.</p>

	<p>But as he walked and walked and walked, and
	looked at the garden, and looked at the little
	orchard, and looked at the house and the top of
	the big chestnut-tree, which showed itself above
	the roof, a thought came into his mind which had
	never been there before&#8212;he was Marietta&#8217;s heir.
	It was a dreadful thing to think of his sister&#8217;s possible
	early departure from this world; but, after
	all, life is life, reality is reality, and business is
	business. He was Marietta&#8217;s only legal heir.</p>

	<p>Of course he had known this before, but it
	had never seemed to be of any importance. He
	was a good deal older than she was, and he had
	always looked upon her as a marrying woman.
	When he made his proposition to Mr. Rooper the
	thought of his own heirship never came into his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75">&nbsp;</a>mind. In fact, if any one had offered him ten
	dollars for said heirship, he would have asked
	fifteen, and would have afterward agreed to split
	the difference and take twelve and a half.</p>

	<p>But now everything had changed. If Marietta
	had anything the matter with her heart there was
	no knowing when all that he saw might be his
	own. No sooner had he walked and thought
	long enough for his mind to fully appreciate the
	altered aspects of his future than he determined
	to instantly thrust out Mr. Rooper from all connection
	with that future. He would go and tell
	him so at once.</p>

	<p>To the dismay of Betsey, who had been watching
	him, expecting that he would soon stop walking
	about and go and saw some wood with which
	to cook the dinner, he went out of the front gate
	and strode rapidly into the village. He had some
	trouble in finding Mr. Rooper, who had gone off
	to take a walk and arrange a conversation with
	which to begin his courtship of Mrs. Himes; but
	he overtook him under a tree by the side of the
	creek. &#8220;Thomas,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have changed
	my mind about that business between us. You
	have been very hard on me, and I&#8217;m not goin&#8217; to
	stand it. I can get the clothes and things I need
	without makin&#8217; myself your slave and workin&#8217;
	myself to death, and, perhaps, settin&#8217; my sister
	agin me for life by tryin&#8217; to make her believe that
	black&#8217;s white, that you are the kind of husband
	<a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76">&nbsp;</a>she ought to have, and that you hate pipes and
	never touch spirits. It would be a mean thing
	for me to do, and I won&#8217;t do it. I did think you
	were a generous-minded man, with the right sort
	of feeling for them as wanted to be your friends;
	but I have found out that I was mistook, and I&#8217;m
	not goin&#8217; to sacrifice my sister to any such person.
	Now that&#8217;s my state of mind plain and
	square.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thomas Rooper shrunk two inches in height.
	&#8220;Asaph Scantle,&#8221; he said, in a voice which seemed
	also to have shrunk, &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you.
	I wasn&#8217;t hard on you. I only wanted to make a
	fair bargain. If I&#8217;d got her, I&#8217;d paid up cash on
	delivery. You couldn&#8217;t expect a man to do more
	than that. But I tell you, Asaph, that I am
	mighty serious about this. The more I have
	thought about your sister the more I want her.
	And when I tell you that I&#8217;ve been a-thinkin&#8217;
	about her pretty much all night, you may know
	that I want her a good deal. And I was intendin&#8217;
	to go to-morrow and begin to court her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Asaph. &#8220;It won&#8217;t
	do no good. If you don&#8217;t have me to back you
	up you might as well try to twist that tree as to
	move her. You can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t mean to go agin me, do you,
	Asaph?&#8221; asked Thomas, ruefully.</p>

	<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tain&#8217;t necessary,&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;You
	will go agin yourself.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77">&nbsp;</a>For a few moments Mr. Rooper remained silent.
	He was greatly discouraged and dismayed by what
	had been said to him, but he could not yet give
	up what had become the great object of his life.
	&#8220;Asaph,&#8221; said he, presently, &#8220;it cuts me to the
	in&#8217;ards to think that you have gone back on me;
	but I tell you what I&#8217;ll do: if you will promise
	not to say anything agin me to Mrs. Himes, and
	not to set yourself in any way between me and
	her, I&#8217;ll go along with you to the store now, and
	you can git that suit of clothes and the umbrella,
	and I&#8217;ll tell &#8217;em to order the dictionary and hand
	it over to you as soon as it comes. I&#8217;d like you
	to help me, but if you will only promise to stand
	out of the way and not hinder, I&#8217;ll do the fair
	thing by you and pay in advance.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said Asaph. &#8220;I do believe you
	think you are the only man that wants Marietta.&#8221;</p>

	<p>A pang passed through the heart of Mr. Rooper.
	He had been thinking a great deal of Mrs. Himes
	and everything connected with her, and he had
	even thought of that visit of Doctor Wicker&#8217;s.
	That gentleman was a widower and a well-to-do
	and well-appearing man; and it would have been
	a long way for him to come just for some trifling
	rickets in a servant-girl. Being really in love, his
	imagination was in a very capering mood, and he
	began to fear that the doctor had come to court
	Mrs. Himes. &#8220;Asaph,&#8221; he said, quickly, &#8220;that&#8217;s
	a good offer I make you. If you take it, in less
	<a class="pagenum" id="page78" title="78">&nbsp;</a>than an hour you can walk home looking like a
	gentleman.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph had taken his reed pipe from his coat
	pocket and was filling it. As he pushed the
	coarse tobacco into the bowl, he considered.
	&#8220;Thomas,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that ain&#8217;t enough. Things
	have changed, and it wouldn&#8217;t pay me. But I
	won&#8217;t be hard on you. I&#8217;m a good friend of
	yourn, and I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do. If you will
	give me now all the things we spoke of between
	us&#8212;and I forgot to mention a cane and pocket-handkerchiefs&#8212;and
	give me, besides, that meerschaum
	pipe of yourn, I&#8217;ll promise not to hinder
	you, but let you go ahead and git Marietta if you
	kin. I must say it&#8217;s a good deal for me to do,
	knowin&#8217; how much you&#8217;ll git and how little you&#8217;ll
	give, and knowin&#8217;, too, the other chances she&#8217;s
	got if she wanted &#8217;em; but I&#8217;ll do it for the sake
	of friendship.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My meerschaum pipe!&#8221; groaned Mr. Rooper.
	&#8220;My Centennial Exhibition pipe!&#8221; His tones
	were so plaintive that for a moment Asaph felt a
	little touch of remorse. But then he reflected that
	if Thomas really did get Marietta the pipe would
	be of no use to him, for she would not allow him
	to smoke it. And, besides, realities were realities
	and business was business. &#8220;That pipe may
	be very dear to you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Thomas, but I
	want you to remember that Marietta&#8217;s very dear
	to me.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79">&nbsp;</a>This touched Mr. Rooper, whose heart was
	sensitive as it had never been before. &#8220;Come
	along, Asaph,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You shall have everything,
	meerschaum pipe included. If anybody
	but me is goin&#8217; to smoke that pipe, I&#8217;d like it to
	be my brother-in-law.&#8221; Thus, with amber-tipped
	guile, Mr. Rooper hoped to win over his friend
	to not only not hinder, but to help him.</p>

	<p>As the two men walked away, Asaph thought
	that he was not acting an unfraternal part toward
	Marietta, for it would not be necessary for him
	to say or do anything to induce her to refuse so
	unsuitable a suitor as Thomas Rooper.</p>

	<p>About fifteen minutes before dinner&#8212;which
	had been cooked with bits of wood which Betsey
	had picked up here and there&#8212;was ready, Asaph
	walked into the front yard of his sister&#8217;s house
	attired in a complete suit of new clothes, thick
	and substantial in texture, pepper-and-salt in color,
	and as long in the legs and arms as the most fastidious
	could desire. He had on a new shirt and
	a clean collar, with a handsome black silk cravat
	tied in a great bow; and a new felt hat was on his
	head. On his left arm he carried an overcoat,
	carefully folded, with the lining outside, and in
	his right hand an umbrella and a cane. In his
	pockets were half a dozen new handkerchiefs
	and the case containing Mr. Rooper&#8217;s Centennial
	meerschaum.</p>

	<p>Marietta, who was in the hallway when he
	<a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80">&nbsp;</a>opened the front door, scarcely knew him as he
	approached.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Asaph!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;What has happened
	to you? Why, you actually look like a
	gentleman!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph grinned. &#8220;Do you want me to go to
	Drummondville right after breakfast to-morrow?&#8221;
	he asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;My dear brother,&#8221; said Marietta, &#8220;don&#8217;t crush
	me by talking about that. But if you could have
	seen yourself as I saw you, and could have felt as
	I felt, you would not wonder at me. You must
	forget all that. I should be proud now to introduce
	you as my brother to any doctor or king or
	president. But tell me how you got those beautiful
	clothes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph was sometimes beset by an absurd regard
	for truth, which much annoyed him. He could
	not say that he had worked for the clothes, and
	he did not wish his sister to think that he had
	run in debt for them. &#8220;They&#8217;re paid for, every
	thread of &#8217;em,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I got &#8217;em in trade.
	These things is mine, and I don&#8217;t owe no man a
	cent for &#8217;em; and it seems to me that dinner must
	be ready.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And proud I am,&#8221; said Marietta, who never
	before had shown such enthusiastic affection for
	her brother, &#8220;to sit down to the table with such
	a nice-looking fellow as you are.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The next morning Mr. Rooper came into Mrs.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81">&nbsp;</a>Himes&#8217;s yard, and there beheld Asaph, in all the
	glory of his new clothes, sitting under the chestnut-tree
	smoking the Centennial meerschaum pipe.
	Mr. Rooper himself was dressed in his very best
	clothes, but he carried with him no pipe.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said Asaph, &#8220;and have a smoke.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the other; &#8220;I am goin&#8217; in the
	house. I have come to see your sister.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; to begin already?&#8221; said Asaph.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the other; &#8220;I told you I was goin&#8217;
	to begin to-day.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said his friend, crossing his pepper-and-salt
	legs; &#8220;and you will finish the 17th
	of August. That&#8217;s a good, reasonable time.&#8221;</p>

	<p>But Mr. Rooper had no intention of courting
	Mrs. Himes for a month. He intended to propose
	to her that very morning. He had been
	turning over the matter in his mind, and for several
	reasons had come to this conclusion. In the
	first place, he did not believe that he could trust
	Asaph, even for a single day, not to oppose him.
	Furthermore, his mind was in such a turmoil
	from the combined effect of the constantly present
	thought that Asaph was wearing his clothes,
	his hat, and his shoes, and smoking his beloved
	pipe, and of the perplexities and agitations consequent
	upon his sentiments toward Mrs. Himes,
	that he did not believe he could bear the mental
	strain during another night.</p>

	<p>Five minutes later Marietta Himes was sitting
	<a class="pagenum" id="page82" title="82">&nbsp;</a>on the horsehair sofa in the parlor, with Mr.
	Rooper on the horsehair chair opposite to her,
	and not very far away, and he was delivering the
	address which he had prepared.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I am a man that takes
	things in this world as they comes, and is content
	to wait until the time comes for them to
	come. I was well acquainted with John Himes.
	I knowed him in life, and I helped lay him out.
	As long as there was reason to suppose that the
	late Mr. Himes&#8212;I mean that the grass over the
	grave of Mr. Himes had remained unwithered, I
	am not the man to take one step in the direction
	of his shoes, nor even to consider the size of &#8217;em
	in connection with the measure of my own feet.
	But time will pass on in nater as well as in real
	life; and while I know very well, Mrs. Himes,
	that certain feelin&#8217;s toward them that was is like
	the leaves of the oak-tree and can&#8217;t be blowed off
	even by the fiercest tempests of affliction, still
	them leaves will wither in the fall and turn brown
	and curl up at the edges, though they don&#8217;t depart,
	but stick on tight as wax all winter until in
	the springtime they is pushed off gently without
	knowin&#8217; it by the green leaves which come out in
	real life as well as nater.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When he had finished this opening Mr. Rooper
	breathed a little sigh of relief. He had not forgotten
	any of it, and it pleased him.</p>

	<p>Marietta sat and looked at him. She had a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page83" title="83">&nbsp;</a>good sense of humor, and, while she was naturally
	surprised at what had been said to her, she
	was greatly amused by it, and really wished to
	hear what else Thomas Rooper had to say to her.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now, madam,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I am not
	the man to thrash a tree with a pole to knock the
	leaves off before their time. But when the young
	leaves is pushin&#8217; and the old leaves is droppin&#8217;
	(not to make any allusion, of course, to any shrivellin&#8217;
	of proper respect), then I come forward,
	madam, not to take the place of anybody else,
	but jest as the nateral consequence of the seasons,
	which everybody ought to expect; even such as
	you, madam, which I may liken to a hemlock-spruce
	which keeps straight on in the same general
	line of appearance without no reference to the
	fall of the year, nor winter nor summer. And so,
	Mrs. Himes, I come here to-day to offer to lead
	you agin to the altar. I have never been there
	myself, and there ain&#8217;t no woman in the world
	that I&#8217;d go with but you. I&#8217;m a straightforward
	person, and when I&#8217;ve got a thing to say I say
	it, and now I have said it. And so I set here
	awaitin&#8217; your answer.&#8221;</p>

	<p>At this moment the shutters of the front window,
	which had been closed, were opened, and
	Asaph put in his head. &#8220;Look here, Thomas
	Rooper,&#8221; he said, &#8220;these shoes is pegged. I
	didn&#8217;t bargain for no pegged shoes; I wanted
	&#8217;em sewed; everything was to be first-class.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84">&nbsp;</a>Mr. Rooper, who had been leaning forward in
	his chair, his hands upon his knees, and his face
	glistening with his expressed feelings as brightly
	as the old-fashioned but shining silk hat which
	stood on the floor by his side, turned his head,
	grew red to the ears, and then sprang to his feet.
	&#8220;Asaph Scantle,&#8221; he cried, with extended fist,
	&#8220;you have broke your word; you hindered.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Asaph, sulkily; &#8220;but
	pegged shoes is too much for any man to stand.&#8221;
	And he withdrew from the window, closing the
	shutters again.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; asked Mrs. Himes,
	who had also risen.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It means,&#8221; said Thomas, speaking with difficulty,
	his indignation was so great, &#8220;that your
	brother is a person of tricks and meanders beyond
	the reach of common human calculation. I
	don&#8217;t like to say this of a man who is more or less
	likely to be my brother-in-law, but I can&#8217;t help
	sayin&#8217; it, so entirely upset am I at his goin&#8217; back
	on me at such a minute.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Going back on you?&#8221; asked Mrs. Himes.
	&#8220;What do you mean? What has he promised?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thomas hesitated. He did not wish to interrupt
	his courtship by the discussion of any new
	question, especially this question. &#8220;If we could
	settle what we have been talkin&#8217; about, Mrs.
	Himes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and if you would give me my
	<a class="pagenum" id="page85" title="85">&nbsp;</a>answer, then I could git my mind down to commoner
	things. But swingin&#8217; on a hook as I am,
	I don&#8217;t know whether my head or my heels is
	uppermost, or what&#8217;s revolvin&#8217; around me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I can give you your answer quickly
	enough,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is impossible for me to
	marry you, so that&#8217;s all settled.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Impossible is a big word,&#8221; said Mr. Rooper.
	&#8220;Has anybody else got afore me?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am not bound to answer that question,&#8221;
	said Marietta, slightly coloring; &#8220;but I cannot
	accept you, Mr. Rooper.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s somebody else, of course,&#8221; said
	Thomas, gazing darkly upon the floor. &#8220;And
	what&#8217;s more, Asaph knew it; that&#8217;s just as clear
	as daylight. That&#8217;s what made him come to me
	yesterday and go back on his first bargain.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; said Mrs. Himes, speaking very
	decidedly, &#8220;I want to know what you mean by
	this talk about bargains.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Mr. Rooper knit his brows. &#8220;This is mighty
	different talk,&#8221; he said, &#8220;from the kind I expected
	when I come here. But you have answered my
	question, now I&#8217;ll answer yours. Asaph Scantle,
	no longer ago than day before yesterday, after
	hearin&#8217; that things wasn&#8217;t goin&#8217; very well with
	me, recommended me to marry you, and agreed
	that he would do his level best, by day and by
	night, to help me git you, if I would give him a
	suit of clothes, an umbrella, and a dictionary.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86">&nbsp;</a>At this Mrs. Himes gave a little gasp and sat
	down.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now, I hadn&#8217;t no thoughts of tradin&#8217; for a
	wife,&#8221; continued Thomas, &#8220;especially in woollen
	goods and books; but when I considered and
	turned the matter over in my mind, and thought
	what a woman you was, and what a life there was
	afore me if I got you, I agreed to do it. Then
	he wanted pay aforehand, and that I wouldn&#8217;t
	agree to, not because I thought you wasn&#8217;t wuth
	it, but because I couldn&#8217;t trust him if anybody
	offered him more before I got you. But that ain&#8217;t
	the wust of it; yesterday he come down to see
	me and went back on his bargain, and that after
	I had spent the whole night thinkin&#8217; of you and
	what I was goin&#8217; to say. And he put on such
	high-cockalorum airs that I, bein&#8217; as soft as mush
	around the heart, jest wilted and agreed to give
	him everything he bargained for if he would promise
	not to hinder. But he wasn&#8217;t satisfied with
	that and wouldn&#8217;t come to no terms until I&#8217;d give
	him my Centennial pipe, what&#8217;s been like a child
	to me this many a year. And when he saw how
	disgruntled I was at sich a loss, he said that my
	pipe might be very dear to me, but his sister was
	jest as dear to him. And then, on top of the
	whole thing, he pokes his head through the shutters
	and hinders jest at the most ticklish moment.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A dictionary and a pipe!&#8221; ejaculated poor
	Marietta, her eyes fixed upon the floor.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;But I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to make him give &#8217;em all back,&#8221;
	exclaimed Thomas. &#8220;They was the price of not
	hinderin&#8217;, and he hindered.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;He shall give them back,&#8221; said Marietta,
	rising, &#8220;but you must understand, Mr. Rooper,
	that in no way did Asaph interfere with your
	marrying me. That was a matter with which he
	did have and could have nothing to do. And now
	I wish you could get away without speaking to
	him. I do not want any quarrelling or high
	words here, and I will see him and arrange the
	matter better than you can do it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I can git away without speakin&#8217; to him,&#8221;
	said Mr. Rooper, with reddened face. And so
	saying, he strode out of the house, through the
	front yard, and out of the gate, without turning
	his head toward Asaph, still sitting under the
	tree.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, ho!&#8221; said the latter to himself; &#8220;she&#8217;s
	bounced him short and sharp; and it serves him
	right, too, after playin&#8217; that trick on me. Pegged
	shoes, indeed!&#8221;</p>

	<p>At this moment the word &#8220;Asaph&#8221; came from
	the house in tones shriller and sharper and higher
	than any in which he had ever heard it pronounced
	before. He sprang to his feet and went to the
	house. His sister took him into the parlor and
	shut the door. Her eyes were red and her face
	was pale. &#8220;Asaph,&#8221; said she, &#8220;Mr. Rooper has
	told me the whole of your infamous conduct. Now
	<a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88">&nbsp;</a>I know what you meant when you said that you
	were making arrangements to get clothes. You
	were going to sell me for them. And when you
	found out that I was likely to marry Doctor Wicker,
	you put up your price and wanted a dictionary
	and a pipe.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, Marietta,&#8221; said Asaph, &#8220;the dictionary
	belonged to the first bargain. If you knew how
	I need a dictionary&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Be still!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I do not want you
	to say a word. You have acted most shamefully
	toward me, and I want you to go away this very
	day. And before you go you must give back to
	Mr. Rooper everything that you got from him.
	I will fit you out with some of Mr. Himes&#8217;s
	clothes and make no conditions at all, only that
	you shall go away. Come upstairs with me, and
	I will get the clothes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The room in the garret was opened, and various
	garments which had belonged to the late
	Mr. Himes were brought out.</p>

	<p>&#8220;This is pretty hard on me, Marietta,&#8221; said
	Asaph, as he held up a coat, &#8220;to give up new
	all-wool goods for things what has been worn and
	is part cotton, if I am a judge.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Marietta said very little. She gave him what
	clothes he needed, and insisted on his putting
	them on, making a package of the things he had
	received from Mr. Rooper, and returning them
	to that gentleman. Asaph at first grumbled, but
	<a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89">&nbsp;</a>he finally obeyed with a willingness which might
	have excited the suspicions of Marietta had she
	not been so angry.</p>

	<p>With an enormous package wrapped in brown
	paper in one hand, and a cane, an umbrella, and
	a very small hand-bag in the other, Asaph approached
	the tavern. Mr. Rooper was sitting on
	the piazza alone. He was smoking a very common-looking
	clay pipe and gazing intently into
	the air in front of him. When his old crony
	came and stood before the piazza he did not turn
	his head nor his eyes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thomas Rooper,&#8221; said Asaph, &#8220;you have got
	me into a very bad scrape. I have been turned
	out of doors on account of what you said about
	me. And where I am goin&#8217; I don&#8217;t know, for I
	can&#8217;t walk to Drummondville. And what&#8217;s more,
	I kept my word and you didn&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t hinder
	you; for how could I suppose that you was goin&#8217;
	to pop the question the very minute you got inside
	the door? And that dictionary you promised
	I&#8217;ve not got.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thomas Rooper answered not a word, but looked
	steadily in front of him. &#8220;And there&#8217;s another
	thing,&#8221; said Asaph. &#8220;What are you goin&#8217; to
	allow me for that suit of clothes what I&#8217;ve been
	wearin&#8217;, what I took off in your room and left
	there?&#8221;</p>

	<p>At this Mr. Rooper sprang to his feet with
	such violence that the fire danced out of the bowl
	<a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90">&nbsp;</a>of his pipe. &#8220;What is the fare to Drummondville?&#8221;
	he cried.</p>

	<p>Asaph reflected a moment. &#8220;Three dollars and
	fifty cents, includin&#8217; supper.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you that for them clothes,&#8221; said the
	other, and counted out the money.</p>

	<p>Asaph took it and sighed. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been hard
	on me, Thomas,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I bear you no
	grudge. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

	<p>As he walked slowly toward the station Mr.
	Scantle stopped at the store. &#8220;Has that dictionary
	come that was ordered for me?&#8221; he said; and
	when told that it could not be expected for several
	days he did not despair, for it was possible that
	Thomas Rooper might be so angry that he would
	forget to countermand the order; in that case he
	might yet hope to obtain the coveted book.</p>

	<p>The package containing the Rooper winter suit
	was heavy, and Asaph walked slowly. He did
	not want to go to Drummondville, for he hated
	bookkeeping, and his year of leisure and good
	living had spoiled him for work and poor fare.
	In this moody state he was very glad to stop and
	have a little chat with Mrs. McJimsey, who was
	sitting at her front window.</p>

	<p>This good lady was the principal dressmaker of
	the village; and by hard work and attention to
	business she made a very comfortable living. She
	was a widow, small of stature, thin of feature, very
	neatly dressed and pleasant to look at. Asaph
	<a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91">&nbsp;</a>entered the little front yard, put his package on
	the door-step, and stood under the window to talk
	to her. Dressed in the clothes of the late Mr.
	Himes, her visitor presented such a respectable
	appearance that Mrs. McJimsey was not in the
	least ashamed to have people see him standing
	there, which she would have been a few days ago.
	Indeed, she felt complimented that he should want
	to stop. The conversation soon turned upon her
	removal from her present abode.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry to have to go,&#8221; she said;
	&#8220;for my time is up just in the middle of my busy
	season, and that&#8217;s goin&#8217; to throw me back dreadfully.
	He hasn&#8217;t done right by me, that Mr.
	Rooper, in lettin&#8217; things go to rack and ruin in
	this way, and me payin&#8217; his rent so regular.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Asaph. &#8220;Thomas Rooper
	is a hard man&#8212;a hard man, Mrs. McJimsey. I
	can see how he would be overbearin&#8217; with a lone
	woman like you, neither your son nor your daughter
	bein&#8217; of age yet to take your part.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Scantle, it&#8217;s very hard.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Asaph stood for a moment looking at a little bed
	of zinnias by the side of the door-step. &#8220;What
	you want, Mrs. McJimsey,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is a man
	in the house.&#8221;</p>

	<p>In an instant Mrs. McJimsey flushed pink. It
	was such a strange thing for a gentleman to say
	to her.</p>

	<p>Asaph saw the flush. He had not expected
	<a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92">&nbsp;</a>that result from his remark, but he was quick to
	take advantage of it. &#8220;Mrs. McJimsey,&#8221; said he,
	&#8220;you are a widow, and you are imposed upon, and
	you need somebody to take care of you. If you
	will put that job into my hands I will do it. I
	am a man what works with his head, and if you
	will let me I&#8217;ll work for you. To put it square,
	I ask you to marry me. My sister&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be
	married, and I&#8217;m on the pint of goin&#8217; away; for I
	could not abear to stay in her house when strangers
	come into it. But if you say the word, I&#8217;ll stay
	here and be yours for ever and ever more.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Mrs. McJimsey said not a word, but her head
	drooped and wild thoughts ran through her brain.
	Thoughts not wild, but well trained and broken,
	ran through Asaph&#8217;s brain. The idea of going
	to Drummondville and spending for the journey
	thither a dollar and seventy-five cents of the money
	he had received from Mr. Rooper now became
	absolutely repulsive to him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mrs. McJimsey,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I will say more.
	Not only do I ask you to marry me, but I ask
	you to do it now. The evenin&#8217; sun is settin&#8217;, the
	evenin&#8217; birds is singin&#8217;, and it seems to me, Mrs.
	McJimsey, that all nater pints to this softenin&#8217;
	hour as a marryin&#8217; moment. You say your son
	won&#8217;t be home from his work until supper-time,
	and your daughter has gone out for a walk. Come
	with me to Mr. Parker&#8217;s, the Methodist minister,
	and let us join hands at the altar there. The
	<a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93">&nbsp;</a>gardener and his wife is always ready to stand
	up as witnesses. And when your son and your
	daughter comes home to supper, they can find
	their mother here afore &#8217;em married and settled.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Scantle,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. McJimsey,
	&#8220;it&#8217;s so suddint. What will the neighbors
	say?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;As for bein&#8217; suddint, Mrs. McJimsey, I&#8217;ve
	knowed you for nearly a year, and now, bein&#8217; on
	the way to leave what&#8217;s been my happy home, I
	couldn&#8217;t keep the truth from you no longer.
	And as for the neighbors, they needn&#8217;t know that
	we hain&#8217;t been engaged for months.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so queer, so very queer,&#8221; said the little
	dressmaker. And her face flushed again, and
	there were tears, not at all sorrowful ones, in her
	eyes; and her somewhat needle-pricked left hand
	accidentally laid itself upon the window-sill in easy
	reach of any one outside.</p>

	<p>The next morning Mr. Rooper, being of a
	practical way of thinking, turned his thoughts
	from love and resentment to the subject of his
	income. And he soon became convinced that it
	would be better to keep the McJimseys in his
	house, if it could be done without too great an
	outlay for repairs. So he walked over to his
	property. When he reached the house he was
	almost stupefied to see Asaph in a chair in the
	front yard, dressed in the new suit of clothes
	<a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94">&nbsp;</a>which he, Thomas Rooper, had paid for, and
	smoking the Centennial pipe.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Mr. Rooper,&#8221; said Asaph, in
	a loud and cheery voice. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ve come
	to talk to Mrs. McJimsey about the work you&#8217;ve
	got to do here to make this house fit to live in.
	But there ain&#8217;t no Mrs. McJimsey. She&#8217;s Mrs.
	Scantle now, and I&#8217;m your tenant. You can talk
	to me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Doctor Wicker came to see Mrs. Himes in the
	afternoon of the day he had promised to come,
	and early in the autumn they were married.
	Since Asaph Scantle had married and settled he
	had not seen his sister nor spoken to her; but he
	determined that on so joyful an occasion as this
	he would show no resentment. So he attended
	the wedding in the village church dressed in the
	suit of clothes which had belonged to the late
	Mr. Himes.</p>

	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">It</span> is now five years since an event occurred
	which so colored my life, or
	rather so changed some of its original
	colors, that I have thought it well to
	write an account of it, deeming that its lessons
	may be of advantage to persons whose situations
	in life are similar to my own.</p>

	<p>When I was quite a young man I adopted literature
	as a profession; and having passed through
	the necessary preparatory grades, I found myself,
	after a good many years of hard and often unremunerative
	work, in possession of what might be
	called a fair literary practice. My articles, grave,
	gay, practical, or fanciful, had come to be considered
	with a favor by the editors of the various
	periodicals for which I wrote, on which I found
	in time I could rely with a very comfortable certainty.
	My productions created no enthusiasm in
	the reading public; they gave me no great reputation
	or very valuable pecuniary return; but they
	<a class="pagenum" id="page98" title="98">&nbsp;</a>were always accepted, and my receipts from them,
	at the time to which I have referred, were as regular
	and reliable as a salary, and quite sufficient to
	give me more than a comfortable support.</p>

	<p>It was at this time I married. I had been engaged
	for more than a year, but had not been
	willing to assume the support of a wife until I
	felt that my pecuniary position was so assured
	that I could do so with full satisfaction to my
	own conscience. There was now no doubt in
	regard to this position, either in my mind or in
	that of my wife. I worked with great steadiness
	and regularity; I knew exactly where to place the
	productions of my pen, and could calculate, with
	a fair degree of accuracy, the sums I should receive
	for them. We were by no means rich; but
	we had enough, and were thoroughly satisfied and
	content.</p>

	<p>Those of my readers who are married will have
	no difficulty in remembering the peculiar ecstasy
	of the first weeks of their wedded life. It is
	then that the flowers of this world bloom brightest;
	that its sun is the most genial; that its clouds
	are the scarcest; that its fruit is the most delicious;
	that the air is the most balmy; that its cigars are
	of the highest flavor; that the warmth and radiance
	of early matrimonial felicity so rarefies the
	intellectual atmosphere that the soul mounts
	higher, and enjoys a wider prospect, than ever
	before.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page99" title="99">&nbsp;</a>These experiences were mine. The plain claret
	of my mind was changed to sparkling champagne,
	and at the very height of its effervescence I wrote
	a story. The happy thought that then struck me
	for a tale was of a very peculiar character; and it
	interested me so much that I went to work at it
	with great delight and enthusiasm, and finished
	it in a comparatively short time. The title of the
	story was &#8220;His Wife&#8217;s Deceased Sister&#8221;; and
	when I read it to Hypatia she was delighted with
	it, and at times was so affected by its pathos that
	her uncontrollable emotion caused a sympathetic
	dimness in my eyes, which prevented my seeing
	the words I had written. When the reading was
	ended, and my wife had dried her eyes, she
	turned to me and said, &#8220;This story will make
	your fortune. There has been nothing so pathetic
	since Lamartine&#8217;s &#8216;History of a Servant-girl.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>As soon as possible the next day I sent my
	story to the editor of the periodical for which I
	wrote most frequently, and in which my best
	productions generally appeared. In a few days I
	had a letter from the editor, in which he praised
	my story as he had never before praised anything
	from my pen. It had interested and charmed, he
	said, not only himself, but all his associates in
	the office. Even old Gibson, who never cared
	to read anything until it was in proof, and who
	never praised anything which had not a joke in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page100" title="100">&nbsp;</a>it, was induced by the example of the others to
	read this manuscript, and shed, as he asserted,
	the first tears that had come from his eyes since
	his final paternal castigation some forty years before.
	The story would appear, the editor assured
	me, as soon as he could possibly find room for it.</p>

	<p>If anything could make our skies more genial,
	our flowers brighter, and the flavor of our fruit
	and cigars more delicious, it was a letter like this.
	And when, in a very short time, the story was
	published, we found that the reading public was
	inclined to receive it with as much sympathetic
	interest and favor as had been shown to it by
	the editors. My personal friends soon began to
	express enthusiastic opinions upon it. It was
	highly praised in many of the leading newspapers;
	and, altogether, it was a great literary
	success. I am not inclined to be vain of my writings,
	and, in general, my wife tells me, think too
	little of them; but I did feel a good deal of pride
	and satisfaction in the success of &#8220;His Wife&#8217;s
	Deceased Sister.&#8221; If it did not make my fortune,
	as my wife asserted that it would, it certainly
	would help me very much in my literary career.</p>

	<p>In less than a month from the writing of this
	story, something very unusual and unexpected
	happened to me. A manuscript was returned by
	the editor of the periodical in which &#8220;His Wife&#8217;s
	Deceased Sister&#8221; had appeared. &#8220;It is a good
	story,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;but not equal to what you
	<a class="pagenum" id="page101" title="101">&nbsp;</a>have just done. You have made a great hit;
	and it would not do to interfere with the reputation
	you have gained by publishing anything inferior
	to &#8216;His Wife&#8217;s Deceased Sister,&#8217; which has
	had such a deserved success.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I was so unaccustomed to having my work
	thrown back on my hands that I think I must
	have turned a little pale when I read the letter. I
	said nothing of the matter to my wife, for it would
	be foolish to drop such grains of sand as this into
	the smoothly oiled machinery of our domestic
	felicity; but I immediately sent the story to another
	editor. I am not able to express the astonishment
	I felt when, in the course of a week,
	it was sent back to me. The tone of the note accompanying
	it indicated a somewhat injured feeling
	on the part of the editor. &#8220;I am reluctant,&#8221;
	he said, &#8220;to decline a manuscript from you; but
	you know very well that if you sent me anything
	like &#8216;His Wife&#8217;s Deceased Sister&#8217; it would be
	most promptly accepted.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I now felt obliged to speak of the affair to my
	wife, who was quite as much surprised, though,
	perhaps, not quite as much shocked, as I had
	been.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Let us read the story again,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
	see what is the matter with it.&#8221; When we had
	finished its perusal, Hypatia remarked, &#8220;It is
	quite as good as many of the stories you have
	had printed, and I think it very interesting; although,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page102" title="102">&nbsp;</a>of course, it is not equal to &#8216;His Wife&#8217;s
	Deceased Sister.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said I; &#8220;that was an inspiration
	that I cannot expect every day. But there
	must be something wrong about this last story
	which we do not perceive. Perhaps my recent
	success may have made me a little careless in
	writing it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that,&#8221; said Hypatia.</p>

	<p>&#8220;At any rate,&#8221; I continued, &#8220;I will lay it
	aside, and will go to work on a new one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>In due course of time I had another manuscript
	finished, and I sent it to my favorite periodical.
	It was retained some weeks, and then came back
	to me. &#8220;It will never do,&#8221; the editor wrote,
	quite warmly, &#8220;for you to go backward. The
	demand for the number containing &#8216;His Wife&#8217;s
	Deceased Sister&#8217; still continues, and we do not
	intend to let you disappoint that great body of
	readers who would be so eager to see another
	number containing one of your stories.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I sent this manuscript to four other periodicals,
	and from each of them was it returned with
	remarks to the effect that, although it was not a
	bad story in itself, it was not what they would expect
	from the author of &#8220;His Wife&#8217;s Deceased
	Sister.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The editor of a Western magazine wrote to me
	for a story to be published in a special number
	which he would issue for the holidays. I wrote
	<a class="pagenum" id="page103" title="103">&nbsp;</a>him one of the character and length he asked for,
	and sent it to him. By return mail it came back
	to me. &#8220;I had hoped,&#8221; the editor wrote, &#8220;when I
	asked for a story from your pen, to receive something
	like &#8216;His Wife&#8217;s Deceased Sister,&#8217; and I
	must own that I am very much disappointed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I was so filled with anger when I read this
	note that I openly objurgated &#8220;His Wife&#8217;s Deceased
	Sister.&#8221; &#8220;You must excuse me,&#8221; I said
	to my astonished wife, &#8220;for expressing myself
	thus in your presence; but that confounded story
	will be the ruin of me yet. Until it is forgotten
	nobody will ever take anything I write.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And you cannot expect it ever to be forgotten,&#8221;
	said Hypatia, with tears in her eyes.</p>

	<p>It is needless for me to detail my literary efforts
	in the course of the next few months. The ideas
	of the editors with whom my principal business
	had been done, in regard to my literary ability,
	had been so raised by my unfortunate story of
	&#8220;His Wife&#8217;s Deceased Sister&#8221; that I found it was
	of no use to send them anything of lesser merit.
	And as to the other journals which I tried, they
	evidently considered it an insult for me to send
	them matter inferior to that by which my reputation
	had lately risen. The fact was that my successful
	story had ruined me. My income was at
	end, and want actually stared me in the face;
	and I must admit that I did not like the expression
	of its countenance. It was of no use for me
	<a class="pagenum" id="page104" title="104">&nbsp;</a>to try to write another story like &#8220;His Wife&#8217;s
	Deceased Sister.&#8221; I could not get married every
	time I began a new manuscript, and it was the
	exaltation of mind caused by my wedded felicity
	which produced that story.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly dreadful!&#8221; said my wife. &#8220;If
	I had had a sister, and she had died, I would have
	thought it was my fault.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It could not be your fault,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;and
	I do not think it was mine. I had no intention of
	deceiving anybody into the belief that I could do
	that sort of thing every time, and it ought not to
	be expected of me. Suppose Raphael&#8217;s patrons
	had tried to keep him screwed up to the pitch of
	the Sistine Madonna, and had refused to buy anything
	which was not as good as that. In that case
	I think he would have occupied a much earlier and
	narrower grave than that on which Mr. Morris
	Moore hangs his funeral decorations.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But, my dear,&#8221; said Hypatia, who was posted
	on such subjects, &#8220;the Sistine Madonna was one
	of his latest paintings.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Very true,&#8221; said I; &#8220;but if he had married,
	as I did, he would have painted it earlier.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I was walking homeward one afternoon about
	this time, when I met Barbel&#8212;a man I had
	known well in my early literary career. He was
	now about fifty years of age, but looked older.
	His hair and beard were quite gray; and his
	clothes, which were of the same general hue,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page105" title="105">&nbsp;</a>gave me the idea that they, like his hair, had
	originally been black. Age is very hard on a
	man&#8217;s external appointments. Barbel had an air
	of having been to let for a long time, and quite
	out of repair. But there was a kindly gleam in
	his eye, and he welcomed me cordially.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, what is the matter, old fellow?&#8221; said
	he. &#8220;I never saw you look so woebegone.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I had no reason to conceal anything from Barbel.
	In my younger days he had been of great
	use to me, and he had a right to know the state
	of my affairs. I laid the whole case plainly
	before him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said, when I had finished,
	&#8220;come with me to my room: I have something I
	would like to say to you there.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I followed Barbel to his room. It was at the
	top of a very dirty and well-worn house which
	stood in a narrow and lumpy street, into which
	few vehicles ever penetrated, except the ash and
	garbage carts, and the rickety wagons of the
	venders of stale vegetables.</p>

	<p>&#8220;This is not exactly a fashionable promenade,&#8221;
	said Barbel, as we approached the house; &#8220;but
	in some respects it reminds me of the streets in
	Italian towns, where the palaces lean over toward
	each other in such a friendly way.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Barbel&#8217;s room was, to my mind, rather more
	doleful than the street. It was dark, it was
	dusty, and cobwebs hung from every corner.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page106" title="106">&nbsp;</a>The few chairs upon the floor and the books
	upon a greasy table seemed to be afflicted with
	some dorsal epidemic, for their backs were either
	gone or broken. A little bedstead in the corner
	was covered with a spread made of New York
	<cite>Heralds</cite>, with their edges pasted together.</p>

	<p>&#8220;There is nothing better,&#8221; said Barbel, noticing
	my glance toward this novel counterpane, &#8220;for
	a bed-covering than newspapers: they keep you as
	warm as a blanket, and are much lighter. I used
	to use <cite>Tribunes</cite>, but they rattled too much.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The only part of the room which was well
	lighted was at one end near the solitary window.
	Here, upon a table with a spliced leg, stood a
	little grindstone.</p>

	<p>&#8220;At the other end of the room,&#8221; said Barbel,
	&#8220;is my cook-stove, which you can&#8217;t see unless I
	light the candle in the bottle which stands by it;
	but if you don&#8217;t care particularly to examine it, I
	won&#8217;t go to the expense of lighting up. You
	might pick up a good many odd pieces of bric-à-brac
	around here, if you chose to strike a match
	and investigate; but I would not advise you to do
	so. It would pay better to throw the things out
	of the window than to carry them downstairs.
	The particular piece of indoor decoration to which
	I wish to call your attention is this.&#8221; And he led
	me to a little wooden frame which hung against
	the wall near the window. Behind a dusty piece
	of glass it held what appeared to be a leaf from a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page107" title="107">&nbsp;</a>small magazine or journal. &#8220;There,&#8221; said he,
	&#8220;you see a page from the <cite>Grasshopper</cite>, a humorous
	paper which flourished in this city some half-dozen
	years ago. I used to write regularly for
	that paper, as you may remember.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh yes, indeed!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;And I
	shall never forget your &#8216;Conundrum of the Anvil&#8217;
	which appeared in it. How often have I laughed
	at that most wonderful conceit, and how often
	have I put it to my friends!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Barbel gazed at me silently for a moment, and
	then he pointed to the frame. &#8220;That printed
	page,&#8221; he said, solemnly, &#8220;contains the &#8216;Conundrum
	of the Anvil.&#8217; I hang it there so that I can
	see it while I work. That conundrum ruined me.
	It was the last thing I wrote for the <cite>Grasshopper</cite>.
	How I ever came to imagine it I cannot tell. It
	is one of those things which occur to a man but
	once in a lifetime. After the wild shout of delight
	with which the public greeted that conundrum,
	my subsequent efforts met with hoots of derision.
	The <cite>Grasshopper</cite> turned its hind legs upon me. I
	sank from bad to worse&#8212;much worse&#8212;until at
	last I found myself reduced to my present occupation,
	which is that of grinding points to pins.
	By this I procure my bread, coffee, and tobacco,
	and sometimes potatoes and meat. One day
	while I was hard at work an organ-grinder came
	into the street below. He played the serenade
	from &#8220;Trovatore&#8221;; and the familiar notes brought
	<a class="pagenum" id="page108" title="108">&nbsp;</a>back visions of old days and old delights, when
	the successful writer wore good clothes and sat at
	operas, when he looked into sweet eyes and talked
	of Italian airs, when his future appeared all a succession
	of bright scenery and joyous acts, without
	any provision for a drop-curtain. And as my ear
	listened, and my mind wandered in this happy
	retrospect, my every faculty seemed exalted, and,
	without any thought upon the matter, I ground
	points upon my pins so fine, so regular and
	smooth, that they would have pierced with ease
	the leather of a boot, or slipped among, without
	abrasion, the finest threads of rare old lace.
	When the organ stopped, and I fell back into my
	real world of cobwebs and mustiness, I gazed
	upon the pins I had just ground, and, without a
	moment&#8217;s hesitation, I threw them into the street,
	and reported the lot as spoiled. This cost me a
	little money, but it saved me my livelihood.&#8221;</p>

	<p>After a few moments of silence, Barbel resumed:</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have no more to say to you, my young friend.
	All I want you to do is to look upon that framed
	conundrum, then upon this grindstone, and then
	to go home and reflect. As for me, I have a gross
	of pins to grind before the sun goes down.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I cannot say that my depression of mind was at
	all relieved by what I had seen and heard. I had
	lost sight of Barbel for some years, and I had
	supposed him still floating on the sun-sparkling
	<a class="pagenum" id="page109" title="109">&nbsp;</a>stream of prosperity where I had last seen him.
	It was a great shock to me to find him in such a
	condition of poverty and squalor, and to see a
	man who had originated the &#8220;Conundrum of the
	Anvil&#8221; reduced to the soul-depressing occupation
	of grinding pin-points. As I walked and thought,
	the dreadful picture of a totally eclipsed future
	arose before my mind. The moral of Barbel sank
	deep into my heart.</p>

	<p>When I reached home I told my wife the story
	of my friend Barbel. She listened with a sad and
	eager interest.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if our fortunes do
	not quickly mend, that we shall have to buy two
	little grindstones. You know I could help you
	at that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>

	<p>For a long time we sat together and talked,
	and devised many plans for the future. I did
	not think it necessary yet for me to look out for
	a pin-contract; but I must find some way of making
	money, or we should starve to death. Of
	course the first thing that suggested itself was
	the possibility of finding some other business;
	but, apart from the difficulty of immediately obtaining
	remunerative work in occupations to which
	I had not been trained, I felt a great and natural
	reluctance to give up a profession for which I
	had carefully prepared myself, and which I had
	adopted as my life-work. It would be very
	hard for me to lay down my pen forever, and to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110">&nbsp;</a>close the top of my inkstand upon all the bright
	and happy fancies which I had seen mirrored in
	its tranquil pool. We talked and pondered the
	rest of that day and a good deal of the night, but
	we came to no conclusion as to what it would be
	best for us to do.</p>

	<p>The next day I determined to go and call upon
	the editor of the journal for which, in happier
	days, before the blight of &#8220;His Wife&#8217;s Deceased
	Sister&#8221; rested upon me, I used most frequently
	to write, and, having frankly explained my condition
	to him, to ask his advice. The editor was
	a good man, and had always been my friend.
	He listened with great attention to what I told
	him, and evidently sympathized with me in my
	trouble.</p>

	<p>&#8220;As we have written to you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the
	only reason why we did not accept the manuscripts
	you sent us was that they would have
	disappointed the high hopes that the public had
	formed in regard to you. We have had letter
	after letter asking when we were going to publish
	another story like &#8216;His Wife&#8217;s Deceased Sister.&#8217;
	We felt, and we still feel, that it would be wrong
	to allow you to destroy the fair fabric which yourself
	has raised. But,&#8221; he added, with a kind
	smile, &#8220;I see very plainly that your well-deserved
	reputation will be of little advantage to
	you if you should starve at the moment that its
	genial beams are, so to speak, lighting you up.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Its beams are not genial,&#8221; I answered.
	&#8220;They have scorched and withered me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;How would you like,&#8221; said the editor, after
	a short reflection, &#8220;to allow us to publish the
	stories you have recently written under some other
	name than your own? That would satisfy us and
	the public, would put money in your pocket, and
	would not interfere with your reputation.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Joyfully I seized that noble fellow by the hand,
	and instantly accepted his proposition. &#8220;Of
	course,&#8221; said I, &#8220;a reputation is a very good
	thing; but no reputation can take the place of
	food, clothes, and a house to live in; and I
	gladly agree to sink my over-illumined name
	into oblivion, and to appear before the public as
	a new and unknown writer.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I hope that need not be for long,&#8221; he said,
	&#8220;for I feel sure that you will yet write stories as
	good as &#8216;His Wife&#8217;s Deceased Sister.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>All the manuscripts I had on hand I now sent
	to my good friend the editor, and in due and
	proper order they appeared in his journal under
	the name of John Darmstadt, which I had selected
	as a substitute for my own, permanently
	disabled. I made a similar arrangement with
	other editors, and John Darmstadt received the
	credit of everything that proceeded from my pen.
	Our circumstances now became very comfortable,
	and occasionally we even allowed ourselves to
	indulge in little dreams of prosperity.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112">&nbsp;</a>Time passed on very pleasantly; one year, another,
	and then a little son was born to us. It is
	often difficult, I believe, for thoughtful persons
	to decide whether the beginning of their conjugal
	career, or the earliest weeks in the life of their
	first-born, be the happiest and proudest period of
	their existence. For myself I can only say that
	the same exaltation of mind, the same rarefication
	of idea and invention, which succeeded upon my
	wedding-day came upon me now. As then, my
	ecstatic emotions crystallized themselves into a
	motive for a story, and without delay I set myself
	to work upon it. My boy was about six weeks
	old when the manuscript was finished; and one
	evening, as we sat before a comfortable fire in
	our sitting-room, with the curtains drawn, and
	the soft lamp lighted, and the baby sleeping
	soundly in the adjoining chamber, I read the
	story to my wife.</p>

	<p>When I had finished, my wife arose and threw
	herself into my arms. &#8220;I was never so proud
	of you,&#8221; she said, her glad eyes sparkling, &#8220;as
	I am at this moment. That is a wonderful story!
	It is&#8212;indeed I am sure it is&#8212;just as good as
	&#8216;His Wife&#8217;s Deceased Sister.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>As she spoke these words a sudden and chilling
	sensation crept over us both. All her warmth and
	fervor, and the proud and happy glow engendered
	within me by this praise and appreciation from
	one I loved, vanished in an instant. We stepped
	<a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113">&nbsp;</a>apart, and gazed upon each other with pallid
	faces. In the same moment the terrible truth
	had flashed upon us both.</p>

	<p>This story <em>was</em> as good as &#8220;His Wife&#8217;s Deceased
	Sister&#8221;!</p>

	<p>We stood silent. The exceptional lot of Barbel&#8217;s
	superpointed pins seemed to pierce our very
	souls. A dreadful vision rose before me of an
	impending fall and crash, in which our domestic
	happiness should vanish, and our prospects for
	our boy be wrecked, just as we had begun to
	build them up.</p>

	<p>My wife approached me and took my hand in
	hers, which was as cold as ice. &#8220;Be strong and
	firm,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A great danger threatens us,
	but you must brace yourself against it. Be
	strong and firm.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I pressed her hand, and we said no more that
	night.</p>

	<p>The next day I took the manuscript I had just
	written, and carefully infolded it in stout wrapping-paper.
	Then I went to a neighboring
	grocery-store and bought a small, strong tin
	box, originally intended for biscuit, with a cover
	that fitted tightly. In this I placed my manuscript;
	and then I took the box to a tinsmith and
	had the top fastened on with hard solder. When
	I went home I ascended into the garret, and
	brought down to my study a ship&#8217;s cash-box,
	which had once belonged to one of my family
	<a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114">&nbsp;</a>who was a sea-captain. This box was very
	heavy, and firmly bound with iron, and was secured
	by two massive locks. Calling my wife, I
	told her of the contents of the tin case, which I
	then placed in the box, and, having shut down
	the heavy lid, I doubly locked it.</p>

	<p>&#8220;This key,&#8221; said I, putting it in my pocket,
	&#8220;I shall throw into the river when I go out this
	afternoon.&#8221;</p>

	<p>My wife watched me eagerly, with a pallid and
	firm, set countenance, but upon which I could see
	the faint glimmer of returning happiness.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to secure it
	still further by sealing-wax and pieces of tape?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I do not believe that any one
	will attempt to tamper with our prosperity. And
	now, my dear,&#8221; I continued, in an impressive
	voice, &#8220;no one but you, and, in the course of
	time, our son, shall know that this manuscript
	exists. When I am dead, those who survive me
	may, if they see fit, cause this box to be split
	open and the story published. The reputation it
	may give my name cannot harm me then.&#8221;</p>

	<h2 class="story_title"><a class="pagenum" id="page117" title="117">&nbsp;</a>THE LADY, OR THE TIGER?</h2>

	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">In</span> the very olden time there lived a semi-barbaric
	king, whose ideas, though
	somewhat polished and sharpened by
	the progressiveness of distant Latin
	neighbors, were still large, florid, and untrammelled,
	as became the half of him which was
	barbaric. He was a man of exuberant fancy,
	and, withal, of an authority so irresistible that,
	at his will, he turned his varied fancies into facts.
	He was greatly given to self-communing; and
	when he and himself agreed upon anything, the
	thing was done. When every member of his
	domestic and political systems moved smoothly
	in its appointed course, his nature was bland and
	genial; but whenever there was a little hitch,
	and some of his orbs got out of their orbits, he
	was blander and more genial still, for nothing
	pleased him so much as to make the crooked
	straight, and crush down uneven places.</p>

	<p>Among the borrowed notions by which his barbarism
	<a class="pagenum" id="page118" title="118">&nbsp;</a>had become semified was that of the public
	arena, in which, by exhibitions of manly and
	beastly valor, the minds of his subjects were refined
	and cultured.</p>

	<p>But even here the exuberant and barbaric fancy
	asserted itself. The arena of the king was built
	not to give the people an opportunity of hearing
	the rhapsodies of dying gladiators, nor to enable
	them to view the inevitable conclusion of a conflict
	between religious opinions and hungry jaws,
	but for purposes far better adapted to widen and
	develop the mental energies of the people. This
	vast amphitheatre, with its encircling galleries,
	its mysterious vaults, and its unseen passages,
	was an agent of poetic justice, in which crime
	was punished, or virtue rewarded, by the decrees
	of an impartial and incorruptible chance.</p>

	<p>When a subject was accused of a crime of sufficient
	importance to interest the king, public notice
	was given that on an appointed day the fate of the
	accused person would be decided in the king&#8217;s
	arena&#8212;a structure which well deserved its name;
	for, although its form and plan were borrowed
	from afar, its purpose emanated solely from the
	brain of this man, who, every barleycorn a king,
	knew no tradition to which he owed more allegiance
	than pleased his fancy, and who ingrafted
	on every adopted form of human thought and
	action the rich growth of his barbaric idealism.</p>

	<p>When all the people had assembled in the galleries,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119">&nbsp;</a>and the king, surrounded by his court, sat
	high up on his throne of royal state on one side
	of the arena, he gave a signal, a door beneath
	him opened, and the accused subject stepped out
	into the amphitheatre. Directly opposite him,
	on the other side of the enclosed space, were two
	doors, exactly alike and side by side. It was
	the duty and the privilege of the person on trial
	to walk directly to these doors and open one of
	them. He could open either door he pleased: he
	was subject to no guidance or influence but that
	of the afore-mentioned impartial and incorruptible
	chance. If he opened the one, there came out of
	it a hungry tiger, the fiercest and most cruel that
	could be procured, which immediately sprang
	upon him and tore him to pieces, as a punishment
	for his guilt. The moment that the case of
	the criminal was thus decided, doleful iron bells
	were clanged, great wails went up from the hired
	mourners posted on the outer rim of the arena,
	and the vast audience, with bowed heads and
	downcast hearts, wended slowly their homeward
	way, mourning greatly that one so young and
	fair, or so old and respected, should have merited
	so dire a fate.</p>

	<p>But if the accused person opened the other
	door, there came forth from it a lady, the most
	suitable to his years and station that his Majesty
	could select among his fair subjects; and to this
	lady he was immediately married, as a reward of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120">&nbsp;</a>his innocence. It mattered not that he might already
	possess a wife and family, or that his affections
	might be engaged upon an object of his own
	selection: the king allowed no such subordinate
	arrangements to interfere with his great scheme
	of retribution and reward. The exercises, as in
	the other instance, took place immediately, and
	in the arena. Another door opened beneath the
	king, and a priest, followed by a band of choristers,
	and dancing maidens blowing joyous airs on
	golden horns and treading an epithalamic measure,
	advanced to where the pair stood side by side; and
	the wedding was promptly and cheerily solemnized.
	Then the gay brass bells rang forth their
	merry peals, the people shouted glad hurrahs, and
	the innocent man, preceded by children strewing
	flowers on his path, led his bride to his home.</p>

	<p>This was the king&#8217;s semibarbaric method of administering
	justice. Its perfect fairness is obvious.
	The criminal could not know out of
	which door would come the lady: he opened
	either he pleased, without having the slightest
	idea whether, in the next instant, he was to be
	devoured or married. On some occasions the
	tiger came out of one door, and on some out of
	the other. The decisions of this tribunal were
	not only fair, they were positively determinate:
	the accused person was instantly punished if he
	found himself guilty; and if innocent, he was
	rewarded on the spot, whether he liked it or not.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121">&nbsp;</a>There was no escape from the judgments of the
	king&#8217;s arena.</p>

	<p>The institution was a very popular one. When
	the people gathered together on one of the great
	trial-days, they never knew whether they were to
	witness a bloody slaughter or a hilarious wedding.
	This element of uncertainty lent an interest to
	the occasion which it could not otherwise have
	attained. Thus the masses were entertained and
	pleased, and the thinking part of the community
	could bring no charge of unfairness against this
	plan; for did not the accused person have the
	whole matter in his own hands?</p>

	<p>This semibarbaric king had a daughter as
	blooming as his most florid fancies, and with a
	soul as fervent and imperious as his own. As is
	usual in such cases, she was the apple of his eye,
	and was loved by him above all humanity. Among
	his courtiers was a young man of that fineness
	of blood and lowness of station common to the
	conventional heroes of romance who love royal
	maidens. This royal maiden was well satisfied
	with her lover, for he was handsome and brave
	to a degree unsurpassed in all this kingdom; and
	she loved him with an ardor that had enough of
	barbarism in it to make it exceedingly warm and
	strong. This love-affair moved on happily for
	many months, until one day the king happened
	to discover its existence. He did not hesitate
	nor waver in regard to his duty in the premises.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page122" title="122">&nbsp;</a>The youth was immediately cast into prison, and
	a day was appointed for his trial in the king&#8217;s
	arena. This, of course, was an especially important
	occasion; and his Majesty, as well as all
	the people, was greatly interested in the workings
	and development of this trial. Never before had
	such a case occurred; never before had a subject
	dared to love the daughter of a king. In after-years
	such things became commonplace enough;
	but then they were, in no slight degree, novel
	and startling.</p>

	<p>The tiger-cages of the kingdom were searched
	for the most savage and relentless beasts, from
	which the fiercest monster might be selected for
	the arena; and the ranks of maiden youth and
	beauty throughout the land were carefully surveyed
	by competent judges, in order that the
	young man might have a fitting bride in case fate
	did not determine for him a different destiny. Of
	course everybody knew that the deed with which
	the accused was charged had been done. He had
	loved the princess, and neither he, she, nor any
	one else thought of denying the fact; but the king
	would not think of allowing any fact of this kind
	to interfere with the workings of the tribunal, in
	which he took such great delight and satisfaction.
	No matter how the affair turned out, the youth
	would be disposed of; and the king would take
	an æsthetic pleasure in watching the course of
	events, which would determine whether or not
	<a class="pagenum" id="page123" title="123">&nbsp;</a>the young man had done wrong in allowing himself
	to love the princess.</p>

	<p>The appointed day arrived. From far and
	near the people gathered, and thronged the great
	galleries of the arena; and crowds, unable to gain
	admittance, massed themselves against its outside
	walls. The king and his court were in their
	places, opposite the twin doors&#8212;those fateful
	portals, so terrible in their similarity.</p>

	<p>All was ready. The signal was given. A door
	beneath the royal party opened, and the lover of
	the princess walked into the arena. Tall, beautiful,
	fair, his appearance was greeted with a low
	hum of admiration and anxiety. Half the audience
	had not known so grand a youth had lived
	among them. No wonder the princess loved him!
	What a terrible thing for him to be there!</p>

	<p>As the youth advanced into the arena, he turned,
	as the custom was, to bow to the king: but he did
	not think at all of that royal personage; his eyes
	were fixed upon the princess, who sat to the right
	of her father. Had it not been for the moiety of
	barbarism in her nature it is probable that lady
	would not have been there; but her intense and
	fervid soul would not allow her to be absent on an
	occasion in which she was so terribly interested.
	From the moment that the decree had gone forth
	that her lover should decide his fate in the king&#8217;s
	arena, she had thought of nothing, night or day,
	but this great event and the various subjects connected
	<a class="pagenum" id="page124" title="124">&nbsp;</a>with it. Possessed of more power, influence,
	and force of character than any one who had
	ever before been interested in such a case, she had
	done what no other person had done&#8212;she had
	possessed herself of the secret of the doors. She
	knew in which of the two rooms that lay behind
	those doors stood the cage of the tiger, with its
	open front, and in which waited the lady. Through
	these thick doors, heavily curtained with skins on
	the inside, it was impossible that any noise or
	suggestion should come from within to the person
	who should approach to raise the latch
	of one of them; but gold, and the power of a
	woman&#8217;s will, had brought the secret to the
	princess.</p>

	<p>And not only did she know in which room stood
	the lady ready to emerge, all blushing and radiant,
	should her door be opened, but she knew who the
	lady was. It was one of the fairest and loveliest
	of the damsels of the court who had been selected
	as the reward of the accused youth, should he be
	proved innocent of the crime of aspiring to one so
	far above him; and the princess hated her. Often
	had she seen, or imagined that she had seen, this
	fair creature throwing glances of admiration upon
	the person of her lover, and sometimes she thought
	these glances were perceived and even returned.
	Now and then she had seen them talking together;
	it was but for a moment or two, but much can be
	said in a brief space; it may have been on most
	<a class="pagenum" id="page125" title="125">&nbsp;</a>unimportant topics, but how could she know that?
	The girl was lovely, but she had dared to raise
	her eyes to the loved one of the princess; and,
	with all the intensity of the savage blood transmitted
	to her through long lines of wholly barbaric
	ancestors, she hated the woman who blushed and
	trembled behind that silent door.</p>

	<p>When her lover turned and looked at her, and
	his eye met hers as she sat there paler and whiter
	than any one in the vast ocean of anxious faces
	about her, he saw, by that power of quick perception
	which is given to those whose souls are one,
	that she knew behind which door crouched the
	tiger, and behind which stood the lady. He had
	expected her to know it. He understood her nature,
	and his soul was assured that she would never
	rest until she had made plain to herself this thing,
	hidden to all other lookers-on, even to the king.
	The only hope for the youth in which there was
	any element of certainty was based upon the success
	of the princess in discovering this mystery;
	and the moment he looked upon her, he saw she
	had succeeded, as in his soul he knew she would
	succeed.</p>

	<p>Then it was that his quick and anxious glance
	asked the question, &#8220;Which?&#8221; It was as plain
	to her as if he shouted it from where he stood.
	There was not an instant to be lost. The question
	was asked in a flash; it must be answered in
	another.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page126" title="126">&nbsp;</a>Her right arm lay on the cushioned parapet before
	her. She raised her hand, and made a slight,
	quick movement toward the right. No one but
	her lover saw her. Every eye but his was fixed
	on the man in the arena.</p>

	<p>He turned, and with a firm and rapid step he
	walked across the empty space. Every heart
	stopped beating, every breath was held, every
	eye was fixed immovably upon that man. Without
	the slightest hesitation, he went to the door
	on the right, and opened it.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Now, the point of the story is this: Did the
	tiger come out of that door, or did the lady?</p>

	<p>The more we reflect upon this question the
	harder it is to answer. It involves a study of
	the human heart which leads us through devious
	mazes of passion, out of which it is difficult to
	find our way. Think of it, fair reader, not as if
	the decision of the question depended upon yourself,
	but upon that hot-blooded, semibarbaric princess,
	her soul at a white heat beneath the combined
	fires of despair and jealousy. She had lost him,
	but who should have him?</p>

	<p>How often, in her waking hours and in her
	dreams, had she started in wild horror and covered
	her face with her hands as she thought of
	her lover opening the door on the other side of
	which waited the cruel fangs of the tiger!</p>

	<p>But how much oftener had she seen him at the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page127" title="127">&nbsp;</a>other door! How in her grievous reveries had
	she gnashed her teeth and torn her hair when she
	saw his start of rapturous delight as he opened the
	door of the lady! How her soul had burned in
	agony when she had seen him rush to meet that
	woman, with her flushing cheek and sparkling
	eye of triumph; when she had seen him lead her
	forth, his whole frame kindled with the joy of recovered
	life; when she had heard the glad shouts
	from the multitude, and the wild ringing of the
	happy bells; when she had seen the priest, with
	his joyous followers, advance to the couple, and
	make them man and wife before her very eyes;
	and when she had seen them walk away together
	upon their path of flowers, followed by the tremendous
	shouts of the hilarious multitude, in
	which her one despairing shriek was lost and
	drowned!</p>

	<p>Would it not be better for him to die at once,
	and go to wait for her in the blessed regions of
	semibarbaric futurity?</p>

	<p>And yet, that awful tiger, those shrieks, that
	blood!</p>

	<p>Her decision had been indicated in an instant,
	but it had been made after days and nights of
	anguished deliberation. She had known she
	would be asked, she had decided what she would
	answer, and, without the slightest hesitation, she
	had moved her hand to the right.</p>

	<p>The question of her decision is one not to be
	<a class="pagenum" id="page128" title="128">&nbsp;</a>lightly considered, and it is not for me to presume
	to set myself up as the one person able to answer
	it. And so I leave it with all of you: Which
	came out of the opened door&#8212;the lady, or the
	tiger?</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">It</span> was half-past one by the clock in the
	office of the Registrar of Woes. The
	room was empty, for it was Wednesday,
	and the Registrar always went
	home early on Wednesday afternoons. He had
	made that arrangement when he accepted the
	office. He was willing to serve his fellow-citizens
	in any suitable position to which he
	might be called, but he had private interests
	which could not be neglected. He belonged to
	his country, but there was a house in the country
	which belonged to him; and there were a great
	many things appertaining to that house which
	needed attention, especially in pleasant summer
	weather. It is true he was often absent on afternoons
	which did not fall on the Wednesday, but
	the fact of his having appointed a particular time
	for the furtherance of his outside interests so emphasized
	<a class="pagenum" id="page132" title="132">&nbsp;</a>their importance that his associates in
	the office had no difficulty in understanding that
	affairs of such moment could not always be attended
	to in a single afternoon of the week.</p>

	<p>But although the large room devoted to the
	especial use of the Registrar was unoccupied,
	there were other rooms connected with it which
	were not in that condition. With the suite of
	offices to the left we have nothing to do, but will
	confine our attention to a moderate-sized room to
	the right of the Registrar&#8217;s office, and connected
	by a door, now closed, with that large and handsomely
	furnished chamber. This was the office
	of the Clerk of Shipwrecks, and it was at present
	occupied by five persons. One of these was the
	clerk himself, a man of goodly appearance, somewhere
	between twenty-five and forty-five years of
	age, and of a demeanor such as might be supposed
	to belong to one who had occupied a high position
	in state affairs, but who, by the cabals of his
	enemies, had been forced to resign the great operations
	of statesmanship which he had been directing,
	and who now stood, with a quite resigned air,
	pointing out to the populace the futile and disastrous
	efforts of the incompetent one who was
	endeavoring to fill his place. The Clerk of Shipwrecks
	had never fallen from such a position,
	having never occupied one, but he had acquired
	the demeanor referred to without going through
	the preliminary exercises.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page133" title="133">&nbsp;</a>Another occupant was a very young man, the
	personal clerk of the Registrar of Woes, who
	always closed all the doors of the office of that
	functionary on Wednesday afternoons, and at
	other times when outside interests demanded his
	principal&#8217;s absence, after which he betook himself
	to the room of his friend the Shipwreck Clerk.</p>

	<p>Then there was a middle-aged man named
	Mathers, also a friend of the clerk, and who was
	one of the eight who had made application for a
	subposition in this department, which was now
	filled by a man who was expected to resign when
	a friend of his, a gentleman of influence in an interior
	county, should succeed in procuring the
	nomination as congressional Representative of his
	district of an influential politician, whose election
	was considered assured in case certain expected
	action on the part of the administration should
	bring his party into power. The person now occupying
	the subposition hoped then to get something
	better, and Mathers, consequently, was
	very willing, while waiting for the place, to visit
	the offices of the department and acquaint himself
	with its duties.</p>

	<p>A fourth person was J. George Watts, a juryman
	by profession, who had brought with him
	his brother-in-law, a stranger in the city.</p>

	<p>The Shipwreck Clerk had taken off his good
	coat, which he had worn to luncheon, and had
	replaced it by a lighter garment of linen, much
	<a class="pagenum" id="page134" title="134">&nbsp;</a>bespattered with ink; and he now produced a
	cigar-box, containing six cigars.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Gents,&#8221; said he, &#8220;here is the fag end of a
	box of cigars. It&#8217;s not like having the pick of a
	box, but they are all I have left.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Mr. Mathers, J. George Watts, and the brother-in-law
	each took a cigar with that careless yet deferential
	manner which always distinguishes the
	treatee from the treator; and then the box was
	protruded in an offhand way toward Harry
	Covare, the personal clerk of the Registrar; but
	this young man declined, saying that he preferred
	cigarettes, a package of which he drew from his
	pocket. He had very often seen that cigar-box
	with a Havana brand, which he himself had
	brought from the other room after the Registrar
	had emptied it, passed around with six cigars, no
	more nor less, and he was wise enough to know
	that the Shipwreck Clerk did not expect to supply
	him with smoking-material. If that gentleman
	had offered to the friends who generally dropped
	in on him on Wednesday afternoon the paper
	bag of cigars sold at five cents each when bought
	singly, but half a dozen for a quarter of a dollar,
	they would have been quite as thankfully received;
	but it better pleased his deprecative soul
	to put them in an empty cigar-box, and thus throw
	around them the halo of the presumption that
	ninety-four of their imported companions had
	been smoked.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page135" title="135">&nbsp;</a>The Shipwreck Clerk, having lighted a cigar
	for himself, sat down in his revolving chair,
	turned his back to his desk, and threw himself
	into an easy cross-legged attitude, which showed
	that he was perfectly at home in that office. Harry
	Covare mounted a high stool, while the visitors
	seated themselves in three wooden arm-chairs.
	But few words had been said, and each man had
	scarcely tossed his first tobacco-ashes on the
	floor, when some one wearing heavy boots was
	heard opening an outside door and entering the
	Registrar&#8217;s room. Harry Covare jumped down
	from his stool, laid his half-smoked cigarette
	thereon, and bounced into the next room, closing
	the door after him. In about a minute he
	returned, and the Shipwreck Clerk looked at him
	inquiringly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;An old cock in a pea-jacket,&#8221; said Mr.
	Covare, taking up his cigarette and mounting
	his stool. &#8220;I told him the Registrar would be
	here in the morning. He said he had something
	to report about a shipwreck, and I told him the
	Registrar would be here in the morning. Had
	to tell him that three times, and then he went.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;School don&#8217;t keep Wednesday afternoons,&#8221;
	said Mr. J. George Watts, with a knowing smile.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said the Shipwreck Clerk, emphatically,
	changing the crossing of his legs.
	&#8220;A man can&#8217;t keep grinding on day in and out
	without breaking down. Outsiders may say what
	<a class="pagenum" id="page136" title="136">&nbsp;</a>they please about it, but it can&#8217;t be done. We&#8217;ve
	got to let up sometimes. People who do the
	work need the rest just as much as those who do
	the looking on.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And more too, I should say,&#8221; observed Mr.
	Mathers.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Our little let-up on Wednesday afternoons,&#8221;
	modestly observed Harry Covare, &#8220;is like death&#8212;it
	is sure to come; while the let-ups we get
	other days are more like the diseases which prevail
	in certain areas&#8212;you can&#8217;t be sure whether
	you&#8217;re going to get them or not.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The Shipwreck Clerk smiled benignantly at this
	remark, and the rest laughed. Mr. Mathers had
	heard it before, but he would not impair the pleasantness
	of his relations with a future colleague by
	hinting that he remembered it.</p>

	<p>&#8220;He gets such ideas from his beastly statistics,&#8221;
	said the Shipwreck Clerk.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Which come pretty heavy on him sometimes,
	I expect,&#8221; observed Mr. Mathers.</p>

	<p>&#8220;They needn&#8217;t,&#8221; said the Shipwreck Clerk,
	&#8220;if things were managed here as they ought to
	be. If John J. Laylor&#8221;&#8212;meaning thereby the
	Registrar&#8212;&#8220;was the right kind of a man you&#8217;d
	see things very different here from what they are
	now. There&#8217;d be a larger force.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Mr. Mathers.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And not only that, but there&#8217;d be better
	buildings and more accommodations. Were any
	<a class="pagenum" id="page137" title="137">&nbsp;</a>of you ever up to Anster? Well, take a run up
	there some day, and see what sort of buildings
	the department has there. William Q. Green is
	a very different man from John J. Laylor. You
	don&#8217;t see him sitting in his chair and picking his
	teeth the whole winter, while the Representative
	from his district never says a word about his department
	from one end of a session of Congress
	to the other. Now if I had charge of things
	here, I&#8217;d make such changes that you wouldn&#8217;t
	know the place. I&#8217;d throw two rooms off here,
	and a corridor and entrance-door at that end of
	the building. I&#8217;d close up this door&#8221;&#8212;pointing
	toward the Registrar&#8217;s room&#8212;&#8220;and if John J.
	Laylor wanted to come in here he might go round
	to the end door like other people.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The thought struck Harry Covare that in that
	case there would be no John J. Laylor, but he
	would not interrupt.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And what is more,&#8221; continued the Shipwreck
	Clerk, &#8220;I&#8217;d close up this whole department at
	twelve o&#8217;clock on Saturdays. The way things
	are managed now, a man has no time to attend
	to his own private business. Suppose I think
	of buying a piece of land, and want to go out and
	look at it, or suppose any one of you gentlemen
	were here and thought of buying a piece of land
	and wanted to go out and look at it, what are you
	going to do about it? You don&#8217;t want to go on
	Sunday, and when are you going to go?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page138" title="138">&nbsp;</a>Not one of the other gentlemen had ever
	thought of buying a piece of land, nor had they
	any reason to suppose that they ever would purchase
	an inch of soil unless they bought it in
	a flower-pot; but they all agreed that the way
	things were managed now there was no time for
	a man to attend to his own business.</p>

	<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t expect John J. Laylor to do
	anything,&#8221; said the Shipwreck Clerk.</p>

	<p>However, there was one thing which that
	gentleman always expected John J. Laylor to do.
	When the clerk was surrounded by a number of
	persons in hours of business, and when he had
	succeeded in impressing them with the importance
	of his functions and the necessity of paying
	deferential attention to himself if they wished their
	business attended to, John J. Laylor would be sure
	to walk into the office and address the Shipwreck
	Clerk in such a manner as to let the people present
	know that he was a clerk and nothing else,
	and that he, the Registrar, was the head of that
	department. These humiliations the Shipwreck
	Clerk never forgot.</p>

	<p>There was a little pause here, and then Mr.
	Mathers remarked:</p>

	<p>&#8220;I should think you&#8217;d be awfully bored with
	the long stories of shipwrecks that the people
	come and tell you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He hoped to change the conversation, because,
	although he wished to remain on good terms with
	<a class="pagenum" id="page139" title="139">&nbsp;</a>the subordinate officers, it was not desirable that he
	should be led to say much against John J. Laylor.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said the Shipwreck Clerk, &#8220;I am
	not bored. I did not come here to be bored, and
	as long as I have charge of this office I don&#8217;t intend
	to be. The long-winded old salts who come
	here to report their wrecks never spin out their
	prosy yarns to me. The first thing I do is to let
	them know just what I want of them; and not an
	inch beyond that does a man of them go, at least
	while I am managing the business. There are
	times when John J. Laylor comes in, and puts
	in his oar, and wants to hear the whole story;
	which is pure stuff and nonsense, for John J.
	Laylor doesn&#8217;t know anything more about a shipwreck
	than he does about&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;The endemies in the Lake George area,&#8221;
	suggested Harry Covare.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes; or any other part of his business,&#8221; said
	the Shipwreck Clerk; &#8220;and when he takes it into
	his head to interfere, all business stops till some
	second mate of a coal-schooner has told his whole
	story from his sighting land on the morning of
	one day to his getting ashore on it on the afternoon
	of the next. Now I don&#8217;t put up with any
	such nonsense. There&#8217;s no man living that can
	tell me anything about shipwrecks. I&#8217;ve never
	been to sea myself, but that&#8217;s not necessary; and
	if I had gone, it&#8217;s not likely I&#8217;d been wrecked.
	But I&#8217;ve read about every kind of shipwreck that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page140" title="140">&nbsp;</a>ever happened. When I first came here I took
	care to post myself upon these matters, because
	I knew it would save trouble. I have read
	&#8216;Robinson Crusoe,&#8217; &#8216;The Wreck of the &#8220;Grosvenor,&#8221;&#8217;
	&#8216;The Sinking of the &#8220;Royal George,&#8221;&#8217; and
	wrecks by water-spouts, tidal waves, and every
	other thing which would knock a ship into a
	cocked hat, and I&#8217;ve classified every sort of wreck
	under its proper head; and when I&#8217;ve found out
	to what class a wreck belongs, I know all about it.
	Now, when a man comes here to report a wreck,
	the first thing he has to do is just to shut down on
	his story, and to stand up square and answer a
	few questions that I put to him. In two minutes
	I know just what kind of shipwreck he&#8217;s had;
	and then, when he gives me the name of his
	vessel, and one or two other points, he may go.
	I know all about that wreck, and I make a much
	better report of the business than he could have
	done if he&#8217;d stood here talking three days and
	three nights. The amount of money that&#8217;s been
	saved to our taxpayers by the way I&#8217;ve systematized
	the business of this office is not to be calculated
	in figures.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The brother-in-law of J. George Watts knocked
	the ashes from the remnant of his cigar, looked
	contemplatively at the coal for a moment, and
	then remarked:</p>

	<p>&#8220;I think you said there&#8217;s no kind of shipwreck
	you don&#8217;t know about?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page141" title="141">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said,&#8221; replied the Shipwreck
	Clerk.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;I could tell you
	of a shipwreck, in which I was concerned, that
	wouldn&#8217;t go into any of your classes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The Shipwreck Clerk threw away the end of
	his cigar, put both his hands into his trousers
	pockets, stretched out his legs, and looked steadfastly
	at the man who had made this unwarrantable
	remark. Then a pitying smile stole over his
	countenance, and he said: &#8220;Well, sir, I&#8217;d like
	to hear your account of it; and before you get a
	quarter through I can stop you just where you
	are, and go ahead and tell the rest of the story
	myself.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Harry Covare. &#8220;You&#8217;ll see
	him do it just as sure pop as a spread rail bounces
	the engine.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said the brother-in-law of J.
	George Watts, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell it.&#8221; And he began:</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">&#8220;It was just two years ago the 1st of this
	month that I sailed for South America in the
	&#8216;Thomas Hyke.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>At this point the Shipwreck Clerk turned and
	opened a large book at the letter T.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That wreck wasn&#8217;t reported here,&#8221; said the
	other, &#8220;and you won&#8217;t find it in your book.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;At Anster, perhaps?&#8221; said the Shipwreck
	Clerk, closing the volume and turning round again.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page142" title="142">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say about that,&#8221; replied the other.
	&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been to Anster, and haven&#8217;t looked
	over their books.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t want to,&#8221; said the clerk.
	&#8220;They&#8217;ve got good accommodations at Anster,
	and the Registrar has some ideas of the duties of
	his post, but they have no such system of wreck
	reports as we have here.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Very like,&#8221; said the brother-in-law. And he
	went on with his story. &#8220;The &#8216;Thomas Hyke&#8217;
	was a small iron steamer of six hundred tons,
	and she sailed from Ulford for Valparaiso with a
	cargo principally of pig-iron.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Pig-iron for Valparaiso?&#8221; remarked the Shipwreck
	Clerk. And then he knitted his brows
	thoughtfully, and said, &#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;She was a new vessel,&#8221; continued the narrator,
	&#8220;and built with water-tight compartments;
	rather uncommon for a vessel of her class, but so
	she was. I am not a sailor, and don&#8217;t know
	anything about ships. I went as passenger, and
	there was another one named William Anderson,
	and his son Sam, a boy about fifteen years old.
	We were all going to Valparaiso on business. I
	don&#8217;t remember just how many days we were out,
	nor do I know just where we were, but it was
	somewhere off the coast of South America, when,
	one dark night&#8212;with a fog besides, for aught I
	know, for I was asleep&#8212;we ran into a steamer
	coming north. How we managed to do this,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page143" title="143">&nbsp;</a>with room enough on both sides for all the ships
	in the world to pass, I don&#8217;t know; but so it was.
	When I got on deck the other vessel had gone on,
	and we never saw anything more of her. Whether
	she sunk or got home is something I can&#8217;t tell.
	But we pretty soon found that the &#8216;Thomas
	Hyke&#8217; had some of the plates in her bow badly
	smashed, and she took in water like a thirsty dog.
	The captain had the forward water-tight bulkhead
	shut tight, and the pumps set to work, but it was
	no use. That forward compartment just filled up
	with water, and the &#8216;Thomas Hyke&#8217; settled down
	with her bow clean under. Her deck was slanting
	forward like the side of a hill, and the propeller
	was lifted up so that it wouldn&#8217;t have
	worked even if the engine had been kept going.
	The captain had the masts cut away, thinking
	this might bring her up some, but it didn&#8217;t help
	much. There was a pretty heavy sea on, and the
	waves came rolling up the slant of the deck like
	the surf on the sea-shore. The captain gave orders
	to have all the hatches battened down so that water
	couldn&#8217;t get in, and the only way by which anybody
	could go below was by the cabin door, which
	was far aft. This work of stopping up all openings
	in the deck was a dangerous business, for
	the decks sloped right down into the water, and
	if anybody had slipped, away he&#8217;d have gone into
	the ocean, with nothing to stop him; but the men
	made a line fast to themselves, and worked away
	<a class="pagenum" id="page144" title="144">&nbsp;</a>with a good will, and soon got the deck and the
	house over the engine as tight as a bottle. The
	smoke-stack, which was well forward, had been
	broken down by a spar when the masts had been
	cut, and as the waves washed into the hole that it
	left, the captain had this plugged up with old sails,
	well fastened down. It was a dreadful thing to
	see the ship a-lying with her bows clean under
	water and her stern sticking up. If it hadn&#8217;t
	been for her water-tight compartments that were
	left uninjured, she would have gone down to the
	bottom as slick as a whistle. On the afternoon
	of the day after the collision the wind fell, and
	the sea soon became pretty smooth. The captain
	was quite sure that there would be no trouble
	about keeping afloat until some ship came along
	and took us off. Our flag was flying, upside
	down, from a pole in the stern; and if anybody
	saw a ship making such a guy of herself as the
	&#8216;Thomas Hyke&#8217; was then doing, they&#8217;d be sure
	to come to see what was the matter with her,
	even if she had no flag of distress flying. We
	tried to make ourselves as comfortable as we
	could, but this wasn&#8217;t easy with everything on
	such a dreadful slant. But that night we heard
	a rumbling and grinding noise down in the hold,
	and the slant seemed to get worse. Pretty soon
	the captain roused all hands and told us that the
	cargo of pig-iron was shifting and sliding down
	to the bow, and that it wouldn&#8217;t be long before
	<a class="pagenum" id="page145" title="145">&nbsp;</a>it would break through all the bulkheads, and
	then we&#8217;d fill and go to the bottom like a shot.
	He said we must all take to the boats and get
	away as quick as we could. It was an easy
	matter launching the boats. They didn&#8217;t lower
	them outside from the davits, but they just let &#8217;em
	down on deck and slid &#8217;em along forward into the
	water, and then held &#8217;em there with a rope till
	everything was ready to start. They launched
	three boats, put plenty of provisions and water
	in &#8217;em, and then everybody began to get aboard.
	But William Anderson and me and his son Sam
	couldn&#8217;t make up our minds to get into those boats
	and row out on the dark, wide ocean. They were
	the biggest boats we had, but still they were little
	things enough. The ship seemed to us to be a
	good deal safer, and more likely to be seen when
	day broke, than those three boats, which might
	be blown off, if the wind rose, nobody knew
	where. It seemed to us that the cargo had done
	all the shifting it intended to, for the noise below
	had stopped; and, altogether, we agreed that
	we&#8217;d rather stick to the ship than go off in those
	boats. The captain he tried to make us go, but we
	wouldn&#8217;t do it; and he told us if we chose to stay
	behind and be drowned it was our affair and he
	couldn&#8217;t help it; and then he said there was a
	small boat aft, and we&#8217;d better launch her, and
	have her ready in case things should get worse
	and we should make up our minds to leave the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page146" title="146">&nbsp;</a>vessel. He and the rest then rowed off so as not
	to be caught in the vortex if the steamer went
	down, and we three stayed aboard. We launched
	the small boat in the way we&#8217;d seen the others
	launched, being careful to have ropes tied to us
	while we were doing it; and we put things aboard
	that we thought we should want. Then we went
	into the cabin and waited for morning. It was a
	queer kind of a cabin, with a floor inclined like
	the roof of a house; but we sat down in the corners,
	and were glad to be there. The swinging
	lamp was burning, and it was a good deal more
	cheerful in there than it was outside. But, about
	daybreak, the grinding and rumbling down below
	began again, and the bow of the &#8216;Thomas Hyke&#8217;
	kept going down more and more; and it wasn&#8217;t
	long before the forward bulkhead of the cabin,
	which was what you might call its front wall
	when everything was all right, was under our
	feet, as level as a floor, and the lamp was lying
	close against the ceiling that it was hanging from.
	You may be sure that we thought it was time to
	get out of that. There were benches with arms
	to them fastened to the floor, and by these we
	climbed up to the foot of the cabin stairs, which,
	being turned bottom upward, we went down in
	order to get out. When we reached the cabin
	door we saw part of the deck below us, standing up
	like the side of a house that is built in the water,
	as they say the houses in Venice are. We had
	<a class="pagenum" id="page147" title="147">&nbsp;</a>made our boat fast to the cabin door by a long line,
	and now we saw her floating quietly on the water,
	which was very smooth and about twenty feet below
	us. We drew her up as close under us as we
	could, and then we let the boy Sam down by a
	rope, and after some kicking and swinging he got
	into her; and then he took the oars and kept her
	right under us while we scrambled down by the
	ropes which we had used in getting her ready.
	As soon as we were in the boat we cut her rope
	and pulled away as hard as we could; and when
	we got to what we thought was a safe distance
	we stopped to look at the &#8216;Thomas Hyke.&#8217; You
	never saw such a ship in all your born days. Two
	thirds of the hull was sunk in the water, and she
	was standing straight up and down with the stern
	in the air, her rudder up as high as the topsail
	ought to be, and the screw propeller looking like
	the wheel on the top of one of these windmills
	that they have in the country for pumping up
	water. Her cargo had shifted so far forward
	that it had turned her right upon end, but she
	couldn&#8217;t sink, owing to the air in the compartments
	that the water hadn&#8217;t got into; and on the
	top of the whole thing was the distress flag flying
	from the pole which stuck out over the stern.
	It was broad daylight, but not a thing did we see
	of the other boats. We&#8217;d supposed that they
	wouldn&#8217;t row very far, but would lay off at a
	safe distance until daylight; but they must have
	<a class="pagenum" id="page148" title="148">&nbsp;</a>been scared and rowed farther than they intended.
	Well, sir, we stayed in that boat all day and
	watched the &#8216;Thomas Hyke&#8217;; but she just kept
	as she was and didn&#8217;t seem to sink an inch.
	There was no use of rowing away, for we had
	no place to row to; and besides, we thought that
	passing ships would be much more likely to see
	that stern sticking high in the air than our little
	boat. We had enough to eat, and at night two
	of us slept while the other watched, dividing off
	the time and taking turns to this. In the morning
	there was the &#8216;Thomas Hyke&#8217; standing stern
	up just as before. There was a long swell on
	the ocean now, and she&#8217;d rise and lean over a
	little on each wave, but she&#8217;d come up again just
	as straight as before. That night passed as the
	last one had, and in the morning we found we&#8217;d
	drifted a good deal farther from the &#8216;Thomas
	Hyke&#8217;; but she was floating just as she had
	been, like a big buoy that&#8217;s moored over a sandbar.
	We couldn&#8217;t see a sign of the boats, and
	we about gave them up. We had our breakfast,
	which was a pretty poor meal, being nothing but
	hardtack and what was left of a piece of boiled
	beef. After we&#8217;d sat for a while doing nothing,
	but feeling mighty uncomfortable, William Anderson
	said, &#8216;Look here, do you know that I think
	we would be three fools to keep on shivering all
	night, and living on hardtack in the daytime,
	when there&#8217;s plenty on that vessel for us to eat
	<a class="pagenum" id="page149" title="149">&nbsp;</a>and to keep us warm. If she&#8217;s floated that way
	for two days and two nights, there&#8217;s no knowing
	how much longer she&#8217;ll float, and we might as
	well go on board and get the things we want as
	not.&#8217; &#8216;All right,&#8217; said I, for I was tired doing
	nothing; and Sam was as willing as anybody. So
	we rowed up to the steamer, and stopped close to
	the deck, which, as I said before, was standing
	straight up out of the water like the wall of a
	house. The cabin door, which was the only
	opening into her, was about twenty feet above us,
	and the ropes which we had tied to the rails of
	the stairs inside were still hanging down. Sam
	was an active youngster, and he managed to
	climb up one of these ropes; but when he got to
	the door he drew it up and tied knots in it about
	a foot apart, and then he let it down to us, for
	neither William Anderson nor me could go up a
	rope hand over hand without knots or something
	to hold on to. As it was, we had a lot of bother
	getting up, but we did it at last; and then we
	walked up the stairs, treading on the front part
	of each step instead of the top of it, as we would
	have done if the stairs had been in their proper
	position. When we got to the floor of the cabin,
	which was now perpendicular like a wall, we had
	to clamber down by means of the furniture, which
	was screwed fast, until we reached the bulkhead,
	which was now the floor of the cabin. Close to
	this bulkhead was a small room which was the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page150" title="150">&nbsp;</a>steward&#8217;s pantry, and here we found lots of
	things to eat, but all jumbled up in a way that
	made us laugh. The boxes of biscuits and the
	tin cans and a lot of bottles in wicker covers were
	piled up on one end of the room, and everything
	in the lockers and drawers was jumbled together.
	William Anderson and me set to work to get out
	what we thought we&#8217;d want, and we told Sam to
	climb up into some of the state-rooms&#8212;of which
	there were four on each side of the cabin&#8212;and
	get some blankets to keep us warm, as well as a
	few sheets, which we thought we could rig up for
	an awning to the boat; for the days were just as
	hot as the nights were cool. When we&#8217;d collected
	what we wanted, William Anderson and
	me climbed into our own rooms, thinking we&#8217;d
	each pack a valise with what we most wanted to
	save of our clothes and things; and while we
	were doing this Sam called out to us that it was
	raining. He was sitting at the cabin door looking
	out. I first thought to tell him to shut the
	door so&#8217;s to keep the rain from coming in; but
	when I thought how things really were, I laughed
	at the idea. There was a sort of little house
	built over the entrance to the cabin, and in one
	end of it was the door; and in the way the ship
	now was the open doorway was underneath the
	little house, and of course no rain could come in.
	Pretty soon we heard the rain pouring down,
	beating on the stern of the vessel like hail. We
	<a class="pagenum" id="page151" title="151">&nbsp;</a>got to the stairs and looked out. The rain was
	falling in perfect sheets, in a way you never see
	except round about the tropics. &#8216;It&#8217;s a good
	thing we&#8217;re inside,&#8217; said William Anderson, &#8216;for
	if we&#8217;d been out in this rain we&#8217;d been drowned
	in the boat.&#8217; I agreed with him, and we made up
	our minds to stay where we were until the rain
	was over. Well, it rained about four hours; and
	when it stopped, and we looked out, we saw our
	little boat nearly full of water, and sunk so deep
	that if one of us had stepped on her she&#8217;d have
	gone down, sure. &#8216;Here&#8217;s a pretty kittle of fish,&#8217;
	said William Anderson; &#8216;there&#8217;s nothing for us
	to do now but to stay where we are.&#8217; I believe
	in his heart he was glad of that, for if ever a man
	was tired of a little boat, William Anderson was
	tired of that one we&#8217;d been in for two days and two
	nights. At any rate, there was no use talking
	about it, and we set to work to make ourselves
	comfortable. We got some mattresses and pillows
	out of the state-rooms, and when it began to get
	dark we lighted the lamp&#8212;which we had filled
	with sweet-oil from a flask in the pantry, not
	finding any other kind&#8212;and we hung it from
	the railing of the stairs. We had a good night&#8217;s
	rest, and the only thing that disturbed me was
	William Anderson lifting up his head every time
	he turned over and saying how much better this
	was than that blasted little boat. The next morning
	we had a good breakfast, even making some
	<a class="pagenum" id="page152" title="152">&nbsp;</a>tea with a spirit-lamp we found, using brandy
	instead of alcohol. William Anderson and I
	wanted to get into the captain&#8217;s room&#8212;which
	was near the stern and pretty high up&#8212;so as to
	see if there was anything there that we ought to
	get ready to save when a vessel should come
	along and pick us up; but we were not good at
	climbing, like Sam, and we didn&#8217;t see how we
	could get up there. Sam said he was sure he
	had once seen a ladder in the compartment just
	forward of the bulkhead, and as William was
	very anxious to get up to the captain&#8217;s room, we
	let the boy go and look for it. There was a sliding
	door in the bulkhead under our feet, and we
	opened this far enough to let Sam get through;
	and he scrambled down like a monkey into the
	next compartment, which was light enough, although
	the lower half of it, which was next to
	the engine-room, was under the water-line. Sam
	actually found a ladder with hooks at one end of
	it, and while he was handing it up to us&#8212;which
	was very hard to do, for he had to climb up on
	all sorts of things&#8212;he let it topple over, and the
	end with the iron hooks fell against the round
	glass of one of the port-holes. The glass was
	very thick and strong, but the ladder came down
	very heavy and shivered it. As bad luck would
	have it, this window was below the water-line,
	and the water came rushing in in a big spout.
	We chucked blankets down to Sam for him to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page153" title="153">&nbsp;</a>stop up the hole, but &#8216;twas of no use; for it was
	hard for him to get at the window, and when he
	did the water came in with such force that he
	couldn&#8217;t get a blanket into the hole. We were
	afraid he&#8217;d be drowned down there, and told him
	to come out as quick as he could. He put up the
	ladder again, and hooked it on to the door in the
	bulkhead, and we held it while he climbed up.
	Looking down through the doorway, we saw, by
	the way the water was pouring in at the opening,
	that it wouldn&#8217;t be long before that compartment
	was filled up; so we shoved the door to and made
	it all tight, and then said William Anderson, &#8216;The
	ship&#8217;ll sink deeper and deeper as that fills up, and
	the water may get up to the cabin door, and we
	must go and make that as tight as we can.&#8217; Sam
	had pulled the ladder up after him, and this we
	found of great use in getting to the foot of the
	cabin stairs. We shut the cabin door, and locked
	and bolted it; and as it fitted pretty tight, we didn&#8217;t
	think it would let in much water if the ship sunk
	that far. But over the top of the cabin stairs
	were a couple of folding doors, which shut down
	horizontally when the ship was in its proper position,
	and which were only used in very bad, cold
	weather. These we pulled to and fastened tight,
	thus having a double protection against the water.
	Well, we didn&#8217;t get this done any too soon, for the
	water did come up to the cabin door, and a little
	trickled in from the outside door and through the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page154" title="154">&nbsp;</a>cracks in the inner one. But we went to work
	and stopped these up with strips from the sheets,
	which we crammed well in with our pocket-knives.
	Then we sat down on the steps and waited to see
	what would happen next. The doors of all the
	state-rooms were open, and we could see through
	the thick plate-glass windows in them, which
	were all shut tight, that the ship was sinking
	more and more as the water came in. Sam
	climbed up into one of the after state-rooms, and
	said the outside water was nearly up to the stern;
	and pretty soon we looked up to the two portholes
	in the stern, and saw that they were covered
	with water; and as more and more water could
	be seen there, and as the light came through less
	easily, we knew that we were sinking under the
	surface of the ocean. &#8216;It&#8217;s a mighty good thing,&#8217;
	said William Anderson, &#8216;that no water can get in
	here.&#8217; William had a hopeful kind of mind, and
	always looked on the bright side of things; but I
	must say that I was dreadfully scared when I
	looked through those stern windows and saw
	water instead of sky. It began to get duskier
	and duskier as we sank lower and lower; but
	still we could see pretty well, for it&#8217;s astonishing
	how much light comes down through water.
	After a little while we noticed that the light remained
	about the same; and then William Anderson
	he sings out, &#8216;Hooray, we&#8217;ve stopped sinking!&#8217;
	&#8216;What difference does that make?&#8217; says I.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page155" title="155">&nbsp;</a>&#8216;We must be thirty or forty feet under water, and
	more yet, for aught I know.&#8217; &#8216;Yes, that may be,&#8217;
	said he; &#8216;but it is clear that all the water has got
	into that compartment that can get in, and we
	have sunk just as far down as we are going.&#8217;
	&#8216;But that don&#8217;t help matters,&#8217; said I; &#8216;thirty or
	forty feet under water is just as bad as a thousand
	as to drowning a man.&#8217; &#8216;Drowning!&#8217; said William;
	&#8216;how are you going to be drowned? No
	water can get in here.&#8217; &#8216;Nor no air, either,&#8217;
	said I; &#8216;and people are drowned for want of air,
	as I take it.&#8217; &#8216;It would be a queer sort of thing,&#8217;
	said William, &#8216;to be drowned in the ocean and
	yet stay as dry as a chip. But it&#8217;s no use being
	worried about air. We&#8217;ve got air enough here to
	last us for ever so long. This stern compartment
	is the biggest in the ship, and it&#8217;s got lots of air
	in it. Just think of that hold! It must be nearly
	full of air. The stern compartment of the hold
	has got nothing in it but sewing-machines. I
	saw &#8217;em loading her. The pig-iron was mostly
	amidships, or at least forward of this compartment.
	Now, there&#8217;s no kind of a cargo that&#8217;ll
	accommodate as much air as sewing-machines.
	They&#8217;re packed in wooden frames, not boxes,
	and don&#8217;t fill up half the room they take. There&#8217;s
	air all through and around &#8217;em. It&#8217;s a very comforting
	thing to think the hold isn&#8217;t filled up solid
	with bales of cotton or wheat in bulk.&#8217; It might
	be comforting, but I couldn&#8217;t get much good out
	<a class="pagenum" id="page156" title="156">&nbsp;</a>of it. And now Sam, who&#8217;d been scrambling all
	over the cabin to see how things were going on,
	sung out that the water was leaking in a little
	again at the cabin door and around some of the
	iron frames of the windows. &#8216;It&#8217;s a lucky thing,&#8217;
	said William Anderson, &#8216;that we didn&#8217;t sink any
	deeper, or the pressure of the water would have
	burst in those heavy glasses. And what we&#8217;ve
	got to do now is to stop up all the cracks. The
	more we work the livelier we&#8217;ll feel.&#8217; We tore off
	more strips of sheets and went all round, stopping
	up cracks wherever we found them. &#8216;It&#8217;s fortunate,&#8217;
	said William Anderson, &#8216;that Sam found
	that ladder, for we would have had hard work
	getting to the windows of the stern state-rooms
	without it; but by resting it on the bottom step
	of the stairs, which now happens to be the top
	one, we can get to any part of the cabin.&#8217; I
	couldn&#8217;t help thinking that if Sam hadn&#8217;t found
	the ladder it would have been a good deal better
	for us; but I didn&#8217;t want to damp William&#8217;s
	spirits, and I said nothing.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And now I beg your pardon, sir,&#8221; said the
	narrator, addressing the Shipwreck Clerk, &#8220;but
	I forgot that you said you&#8217;d finish this story yourself.
	Perhaps you&#8217;d like to take it up just here?&#8221;</p>

	<p>The Shipwreck Clerk seemed surprised, and
	had apparently forgotten his previous offer. &#8220;Oh
	no,&#8221; said he, &#8220;tell your own story. This is not
	a matter of business.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page157" title="157">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; said the brother-in-law of
	J. George Watts, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go on. We made everything
	as tight as we could, and then we got our
	supper, having forgotten all about dinner, and
	being very hungry. We didn&#8217;t make any tea and
	we didn&#8217;t light the lamp, for we knew that would
	use up air; but we made a better meal than three
	people sunk out of sight in the ocean had a right
	to expect. &#8216;What troubles me most,&#8217; said William
	Anderson, as he turned in, &#8216;is the fact that if we
	are forty feet under water our flagpole must be
	covered up. Now, if the flag was sticking out,
	upside down, a ship sailing by would see it and
	would know there was something wrong.&#8217; &#8216;If
	that&#8217;s all that troubles you,&#8217; said I, &#8216;I guess
	you&#8217;ll sleep easy. And if a ship was to see the
	flag, I wonder how they&#8217;d know we were down
	here, and how they&#8217;d get us out if they did!&#8217;
	&#8216;Oh, they&#8217;d manage it,&#8217; said William Anderson;
	&#8216;trust those sea-captains for that.&#8217; And then he
	went to sleep. The next morning the air began
	to get mighty disagreeable in the part of the cabin
	where we were, and then William Anderson he
	says, &#8216;What we&#8217;ve got to do is to climb up into
	the stern state-rooms, where the air is purer.
	We can come down here to get our meals, and
	then go up again to breathe comfortable.&#8217; &#8216;And
	what are we going to do when the air up there
	gets foul?&#8217; says I to William, who seemed to be
	making arrangements for spending the summer
	<a class="pagenum" id="page158" title="158">&nbsp;</a>in our present quarters. &#8216;Oh, that&#8217;ll be all right,&#8217;
	said he. &#8216;It don&#8217;t do to be extravagant with air
	any more than with anything else. When we&#8217;ve
	used up all there is in this cabin, we can bore
	holes through the floor into the hold and let in
	air from there. If we&#8217;re economical, there&#8217;ll be
	enough to last for dear knows how long.&#8217; We
	passed the night each in a state-room, sleeping
	on the end wall instead of the berth, and it wasn&#8217;t
	till the afternoon of the next day that the air of
	the cabin got so bad we thought we&#8217;d have some
	fresh; so we went down on the bulkhead, and
	with an auger that we found in the pantry we
	bored three holes, about a yard apart, in the cabin
	floor, which was now one of the walls of the room,
	just as the bulkhead was the floor, and the stern
	end, where the two round windows were, was the
	ceiling or roof. We each took a hole, and I tell
	you it was pleasant to breathe the air which came
	in from the hold. &#8216;Isn&#8217;t this jolly?&#8217; said William
	Anderson. &#8216;And we ought to be mighty glad
	that that hold wasn&#8217;t loaded with codfish or soap.
	But there&#8217;s nothing that smells better than new
	sewing-machines that haven&#8217;t ever been used,
	and this air is pleasant enough for anybody.&#8217; By
	William&#8217;s advice we made three plugs, by which
	we stopped up the holes when we thought we&#8217;d
	had air enough for the present. &#8216;And now,&#8217; says
	he, &#8216;we needn&#8217;t climb up into those awkward
	state-rooms any more. We can just stay down
	<a class="pagenum" id="page159" title="159">&nbsp;</a>here and be comfortable, and let in air when we
	want it.&#8217; &#8216;And how long do you suppose that
	air in the hold is going to last?&#8217; said I. &#8216;Oh,
	ever so long,&#8217; said he, &#8216;using it so economically
	as we do; and when it stops coming out lively
	through these little holes, as I suppose it will
	after a while, we can saw a big hole in this flooring
	and go into the hold and do our breathing, if
	we want to.&#8217; That evening we did saw a hole
	about a foot square, so as to have plenty of air
	while we were asleep; but we didn&#8217;t go into the
	hold, it being pretty well filled up with machines;
	though the next day Sam and I sometimes stuck
	our heads in for a good sniff of air, though William
	Anderson was opposed to this, being of the
	opinion that we ought to put ourselves on short
	rations of breathing so as to make the supply of
	air hold out as long as possible. &#8216;But what&#8217;s the
	good,&#8217; said I to William, &#8216;of trying to make the
	air hold out if we&#8217;ve got to be suffocated in this
	place after all?&#8217; &#8216;What&#8217;s the good?&#8217; says he.
	&#8216;Haven&#8217;t you enough biscuits and canned meats
	and plenty of other things to eat, and a barrel of
	water in that room opposite the pantry, not to
	speak of wine and brandy if you want to cheer
	yourself up a bit, and haven&#8217;t we good mattresses
	to sleep on, and why shouldn&#8217;t we try to live and
	be comfortable as long as we can?&#8217; &#8216;What I
	want,&#8217; said I, &#8216;is to get out of this box. The
	idea of being shut up in here down under the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page160" title="160">&nbsp;</a>water is more than I can stand. I&#8217;d rather take
	my chances going up to the surface and swimming
	about till I found a piece of the wreck, or something
	to float on.&#8217; &#8216;You needn&#8217;t think of anything
	of that sort,&#8217; said William, &#8216;for if we were
	to open a door or a window to get out, the
	water&#8217;d rush in and drive us back and fill up this
	place in no time; and then the whole concern
	would go to the bottom. And what would you
	do if you did get to the top of the water? It&#8217;s
	not likely you&#8217;d find anything there to get on,
	and if you did you wouldn&#8217;t live very long floating
	about with nothing to eat. No, sir,&#8217; says he,
	&#8216;what we&#8217;ve got to do is to be content with the
	comforts we have around us, and something will
	turn up to get us out of this; you see if it don&#8217;t.&#8217;
	There was no use talking against William Anderson,
	and I didn&#8217;t say any more about getting out.
	As for Sam, he spent his time at the windows of
	the state-rooms a-looking out. We could see a
	good way into the water&#8212;farther than you would
	think&#8212;and we sometimes saw fishes, especially
	porpoises, swimming about, most likely trying to
	find out what a ship was doing hanging bows down
	under the water. What troubled Sam was that a
	swordfish might come along and jab his sword
	through one of the windows. In that case it
	would be all up, or rather down, with us.
	Every now and then he&#8217;d sing out, &#8216;Here comes
	one!&#8217; And then, just as I&#8217;d give a jump, he&#8217;d
	<a class="pagenum" id="page161" title="161">&nbsp;</a>say, &#8216;No, it isn&#8217;t; it&#8217;s a porpoise.&#8217; I thought
	from the first, and I think now, that it would have
	been a great deal better for us if that boy hadn&#8217;t
	been along. That night there was a good deal of
	motion to the ship, and she swung about and rose
	up and down more than she had done since we&#8217;d
	been left in her. &#8216;There must be a big sea running
	on top,&#8217; said William Anderson, &#8216;and if we
	were up there we&#8217;d be tossed about dreadful.
	Now the motion down here is just as easy as a
	cradle; and, what&#8217;s more, we can&#8217;t be sunk very
	deep, for if we were there wouldn&#8217;t be any motion
	at all.&#8217; About noon the next day we felt a sudden
	tremble and shake run through the whole ship,
	and far down under us we heard a rumbling and
	grinding that nearly scared me out of my wits. I
	first thought we&#8217;d struck bottom; but William he
	said that couldn&#8217;t be, for it was just as light in
	the cabin as it had been, and if we&#8217;d gone down
	it would have grown much darker, of course.
	The rumbling stopped after a little while, and
	then it seemed to grow lighter instead of darker;
	and Sam, who was looking up at the stern windows
	over our heads, he sung out, &#8216;Sky!&#8217; And,
	sure enough, we could see the blue sky, as clear
	as daylight, through those windows! And then
	the ship she turned herself on the slant, pretty
	much as she had been when her forward compartment
	first took in water, and we found ourselves
	standing on the cabin floor <ins id="ins2" class="correction" title="intead">instead</ins> of the bulkhead.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page162" title="162">&nbsp;</a>I was near one of the open state-rooms, and as I
	looked in there was the sunlight coming through
	the wet glass in the window, and more cheerful
	than anything I ever saw before in this world.
	William Anderson he just made one jump, and,
	unscrewing one of the state-room windows, he
	jerked it open. We had thought the air inside
	was good enough to last some time longer; but
	when that window was open and the fresh air
	came rushing in, it was a different sort of thing,
	I can tell you. William put his head out and
	looked up and down and all around. &#8216;She&#8217;s
	nearly all out of water,&#8217; he shouted, &#8216;and we can
	open the cabin door!&#8217; Then we all three rushed
	at those stairs, which were nearly right side up
	now, and we had the cabin doors open in no
	time. When we looked out we saw that the
	ship was truly floating pretty much as she had
	been when the captain and crew left her, though
	we all agreed that her deck didn&#8217;t slant as much
	forward as it did then. &#8216;Do you know what&#8217;s
	happened?&#8217; sung out William Anderson, after
	he&#8217;d stood still for a minute to look around and
	think. &#8216;That bobbing up and down that the
	vessel got last night shook up and settled down
	the pig-iron inside of her, and the iron plates in
	the bow, that were smashed and loosened by the
	collision, have given way under the weight, and
	the whole cargo of pig-iron has burst through
	and gone to the bottom. Then, of course, up we
	<a class="pagenum" id="page163" title="163">&nbsp;</a>came. Didn&#8217;t I tell you something would happen
	to make us all right?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t make this story any longer
	than I can help. The next day after that we
	were taken off by a sugar-ship bound north, and
	we were carried safe back to Ulford, where we
	found our captain and the crew, who had been
	picked up by a ship after they&#8217;d been three or
	four days in their boats. This ship had sailed our
	way to find us, which, of course, she couldn&#8217;t do,
	as at that time we were under water and out of
	sight.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And now, sir,&#8221; said the brother-in-law of J.
	George Watts to the Shipwreck Clerk, &#8220;to which
	of your classes does this wreck of mine belong?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Gents,&#8221; said the Shipwreck Clerk, rising from
	his seat, &#8220;it&#8217;s four o&#8217;clock, and at that hour this
	office closes.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">A mountain</span> brook ran through a
	little village. Over the brook there
	was a narrow bridge, and from the
	bridge a foot-path led out from the
	village and up the hillside to the cottage of Old
	Pipes and his mother. For many, many years
	Old Pipes had been employed by the villagers to
	pipe the cattle down from the hills. Every afternoon,
	an hour before sunset, he would sit on a
	rock in front of his cottage and play on his pipes.
	Then all the flocks and herds that were grazing
	on the mountains would hear him, wherever they
	might happen to be, and would come down to the
	village&#8212;the cows by the easiest paths, the sheep
	by those not quite so easy, and the goats by the
	steep and rocky ways that were hardest of all.</p>

	<p>But now, for a year or more, Old Pipes had not
	piped the cattle home. It is true that every afternoon
	he sat upon the rock and played upon his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page168" title="168">&nbsp;</a>familiar instrument; but the cattle did not hear
	him. He had grown old and his breath was
	feeble. The echoes of his cheerful notes, which
	used to come from the rocky hill on the other
	side of the valley, were heard no more; and
	twenty yards from Old Pipes one could scarcely
	tell what tune he was playing. He had become
	somewhat deaf, and did not know that the sound
	of his pipes was so thin and weak, and that the
	cattle did not hear him. The cows, the sheep,
	and the goats came down every afternoon as before,
	but this was because two boys and a girl
	were sent up after them. The villagers did not
	wish the good old man to know that his piping
	was no longer of any use, so they paid him his
	little salary every month, and said nothing about
	the two boys and the girl.</p>

	<p>Old Pipes&#8217;s mother was, of course, a great deal
	older than he was, and was as deaf as a gate&#8212;posts,
	latch, hinges, and all&#8212;and she never knew
	that the sound of her son&#8217;s pipe did not spread
	over all the mountain-side and echo back strong
	and clear from the opposite hills. She was very
	fond of Old Pipes, and proud of his piping; and
	as he was so much younger than she was, she
	never thought of him as being very old. She
	cooked for him, and made his bed, and mended
	his clothes; and they lived very comfortably on
	his little salary.</p>

	<p>One afternoon, at the end of the month, when
	<a class="pagenum" id="page169" title="169">&nbsp;</a>Old Pipes had finished his piping, he took his
	stout staff and went down the hill to the village
	to receive the money for his month&#8217;s work. The
	path seemed a great deal steeper and more difficult
	than it used to be; and Old Pipes thought
	that it must have been washed by the rains and
	greatly damaged. He remembered it as a path
	that was quite easy to traverse either up or down.
	But Old Pipes had been a very active man, and
	as his mother was so much older than he was, he
	never thought of himself as aged and infirm.</p>

	<p>When the Chief Villager had paid him, and he
	had talked a little with some of his friends, Old
	Pipes started to go home. But when he had
	crossed the bridge over the brook and gone a
	short distance up the hillside, he became very
	tired and sat down upon a stone. He had not
	been sitting there half a minute when along came
	two boys and a girl.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Children,&#8221; said Old Pipes, &#8220;I&#8217;m very tired
	to-night, and I don&#8217;t believe I can climb up this
	steep path to my home. I think I shall have to
	ask you to help me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;We will do that,&#8221; said the boys and the girl,
	quite cheerfully; and one boy took him by the
	right hand and the other by the left, while the
	girl pushed him in the back. In this way he
	went up the hill quite easily, and soon reached
	his cottage door. Old Pipes gave each of the
	three children a copper coin, and then they sat
	<a class="pagenum" id="page170" title="170">&nbsp;</a>down for a few minutes&#8217; rest before starting back
	to the village.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that I tired you so much,&#8221; said Old
	Pipes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, that would not have tired us,&#8221; said one
	of the boys, &#8220;if we had not been so far to-day
	after the cows, the sheep, and the goats. They
	rambled high up on the mountain, and we never
	before had such a time in finding them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Had to go after the cows, the sheep, and the
	goats!&#8221; exclaimed Old Pipes. &#8220;What do you
	mean by that?&#8221;</p>

	<p>The girl, who stood behind the old man, shook
	her head, put her hand on her mouth, and made
	all sorts of signs to the boy to stop talking on this
	subject; but he did not notice her and promptly
	answered Old Pipes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, you see, good sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that as
	the cattle can&#8217;t hear your pipes now, somebody
	has to go after them every evening to drive them
	down from the mountain, and the Chief Villager
	has hired us three to do it. Generally it is not
	very hard work, but to-night the cattle had wandered
	far.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;How long have you been doing this?&#8221; asked
	the old man.</p>

	<p>The girl shook her head and clapped her hand
	on her mouth more vigorously than before, but
	the boy went on.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I think it is about a year now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;since
	<a class="pagenum" id="page171" title="171">&nbsp;</a>the people first felt sure that the cattle could not
	hear your pipes; and from that time we&#8217;ve been
	driving them down. But we are rested now and
	will go home. Good-night, sir.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The three children then went down the hill,
	the girl scolding the boy all the way home. Old
	Pipes stood silent a few moments and then he
	went into his cottage.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;did you hear what
	those children said?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Children!&#8221; exclaimed the old woman; &#8220;I
	did not hear them. I did not know there were
	any children here.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then Old Pipes told his mother&#8212;shouting
	very loudly to make her hear&#8212;how the two
	boys and the girl had helped him up the hill,
	and what he had heard about his piping and the
	cattle.</p>

	<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t hear you?&#8221; cried his mother.
	&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter with the cattle?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah me!&#8221; said Old Pipes, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
	there&#8217;s anything the matter with the cattle. It
	must be with me and my pipes that there is
	something the matter. But one thing is certain:
	if I do not earn the wages the Chief Villager
	pays me, I shall not take them. I shall go
	straight down to the village and give back the
	money I received to-day.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; cried his mother. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure
	you&#8217;ve piped as well as you could, and no more
	<a class="pagenum" id="page172" title="172">&nbsp;</a>can be expected. And what are we to do without
	the money?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Old Pipes; &#8220;but I&#8217;m
	going down to the village to pay it back.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The sun had now set; but the moon was shining
	very brightly on the hillside, and Old Pipes
	could see his way very well. He did not take
	the same path by which he had gone before, but
	followed another, which led among the trees upon
	the hillside, and, though longer, was not so steep.</p>

	<p>When he had gone about half-way the old man
	sat down to rest, leaning his back against a great
	oak-tree. As he did so he heard a sound like
	knocking inside the tree, and then a voice distinctly
	said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Let me out! let me out!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Old Pipes instantly forgot that he was tired,
	and sprang to his feet. &#8220;This must be a Dryad-tree!&#8221;
	he exclaimed. &#8220;If it is, I&#8217;ll let her out.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Old Pipes had never, to his knowledge, seen a
	Dryad-tree, but he knew there were such trees on
	the hillsides and the mountains, and that Dryads
	lived in them. He knew, too, that in the summer-time,
	on those days when the moon rose before
	the sun went down, a Dryad could come out
	of her tree if any one could find the key which
	locked her in, and turn it. Old Pipes closely
	examined the trunk of the tree, which stood in
	the full moonlight. &#8220;If I see that key,&#8221; he said,
	&#8220;I shall surely turn it.&#8221; Before long he perceived
	<a class="pagenum" id="page173" title="173">&nbsp;</a>a piece of bark standing out from the tree,
	which appeared to him very much like the handle
	of a key. He took hold of it, and found he could
	turn it quite around. As he did so a large part
	of the side of the tree was pushed open, and a
	beautiful Dryad stepped quickly out.</p>

	<p>For a moment she stood motionless, gazing on
	the scene before her&#8212;the tranquil valley, the
	hills, the forest, and the mountain-side, all lying
	in the soft clear light of the moon. &#8220;Oh, lovely!
	lovely!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;How long it is since
	I have seen anything like this!&#8221; And then, turning
	to Old Pipes, she said, &#8220;How good of you to
	let me out! I am so happy and so thankful that
	I must kiss you, you dear old man!&#8221; And she
	threw her arms around the neck of Old Pipes and
	kissed him on both cheeks. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know,&#8221;
	she then went on to say, &#8220;how doleful it is to be
	shut up so long in a tree. I don&#8217;t mind it in the
	winter, for then I am glad to be sheltered; but in
	summer it is a rueful thing not to be able to see
	all the beauties of the world. And it&#8217;s ever so
	long since I&#8217;ve been let out. People so seldom
	come this way; and when they do come at the
	right time they either don&#8217;t hear me, or they are
	frightened and run away. But you, you dear old
	man, you were not frightened, and you looked
	and looked for the key, and you let me out, and
	now I shall not have to go back till winter has
	come and the air grows cold. Oh, it is glorious!
	<a class="pagenum" id="page174" title="174">&nbsp;</a>What can I do for you to show you how grateful
	I am?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am very glad,&#8221; said Old Pipes, &#8220;that I let
	you out, since I see that it makes you so happy;
	but I must admit that I tried to find the key because
	I had a great desire to see a Dryad. But
	if you wish to do something for me, you can,
	if you happen to be going down toward the
	village.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;To the village!&#8221; exclaimed the Dryad. &#8220;I
	will go anywhere for you, my kind old benefactor.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Old Pipes, &#8220;I wish you
	would take this little bag of money to the Chief
	Villager and tell him that Old Pipes cannot receive
	pay for the services which he does not perform.
	It is now more than a year that I have not
	been able to make the cattle hear me when I piped
	to call them home. I did not know this until to-night;
	but now that I know it I cannot keep the
	money, and so I send it back.&#8221; And, handing
	the little bag to the Dryad, he bade her good-night
	and turned toward his cottage.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; said the Dryad. &#8220;And I
	thank you over and over and over again, you
	good old man!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Old Pipes walked toward his home, very glad
	to be saved the fatigue of going all the way down
	to the village and back again. &#8220;To be sure,&#8221;
	he said to himself, &#8220;this path does not seem at
	<a class="pagenum" id="page175" title="175">&nbsp;</a>all steep, and I can walk along it very easily; but
	it would have tired me dreadfully to come up all
	the way from the village, especially as I could not
	have expected those children to help me again.&#8221;
	When he reached home his mother was surprised
	to see him returning so soon.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;have you already
	come back? What did the Chief Villager say?
	Did he take the money?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Old Pipes was just about to tell her that he had
	sent the money to the village by a Dryad when he
	suddenly reflected that his mother would be sure
	to disapprove such a proceeding, and so he merely
	said he had sent it by a person whom he had met.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And how do you know that the person will
	ever take it to the Chief Villager?&#8221; cried his
	mother. &#8220;You will lose it, and the villagers
	will never get it. Oh, Pipes! Pipes! when will
	you be old enough to have ordinary common
	sense?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Old Pipes considered that as he was already
	seventy years of age he could scarcely expect to
	grow any wiser, but he made no remark on this
	subject; and, saying that he doubted not that the
	money would go safely to its destination, he sat
	down to his supper. His mother scolded him
	roundly, but he did not mind it; and after supper
	he went out and sat on a rustic chair in front of
	the cottage to look at the moon-lit village, and to
	wonder whether or not the Chief Villager really
	<a class="pagenum" id="page176" title="176">&nbsp;</a>received the money. While he was doing these
	two things he went fast asleep.</p>

	<p>When Old Pipes left the Dryad, she did not go
	down to the village with the little bag of money.
	She held it in her hand and thought about what
	she had heard. &#8220;This is a good and honest old
	man,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and it is a shame that he should
	lose this money. He looked as if he needed it,
	and I don&#8217;t believe the people in the village will
	take it from one who has served them so long.
	Often, when in my tree, have I heard the sweet
	notes of his pipes. I am going to take the money
	back to him.&#8221; She did not start immediately, because
	there were so many beautiful things to look
	at; but after a while she went up to the cottage,
	and, finding Old Pipes asleep in his chair, she
	slipped the little bag into his coat pocket and
	silently sped away.</p>

	<p>The next day Old Pipes told his mother that
	he would go up the mountain and cut some wood.
	He had a right to get wood from the mountain,
	but for a long time he had been content to pick
	up the dead branches which lay about his cottage.
	To-day, however, he felt so strong and vigorous
	that he thought he would go and cut some fuel
	that would be better than this. He worked all
	the morning, and when he came back he did not
	feel at all tired, and he had a very good appetite
	for his dinner.</p>

	<p>Now, Old Pipes knew a good deal about
	<a class="pagenum" id="page177" title="177">&nbsp;</a>Dryads, but there was one thing which, although
	he had heard, he had forgotten. This was that
	a kiss from a Dryad made a person ten years
	younger. The people of the village knew this,
	and they were very careful not to let any child of
	ten years or younger go into the woods where the
	Dryads were supposed to be; for if they should
	chance to be kissed by one of these tree-nymphs,
	they would be set back so far that they would
	cease to exist. A story was told in the village
	that a very bad boy of eleven once ran away into
	the woods and had an adventure of this kind; and
	when his mother found him he was a little baby
	of one year old. Taking advantage of her opportunity,
	she brought him up more carefully than
	she had done before; and he grew to be a very
	good boy indeed.</p>

	<p>Now, Old Pipes had been kissed twice by the
	Dryad, once on each cheek, and he therefore felt
	as vigorous and active as when he was a hale man
	of fifty. His mother noticed how much work he
	was doing, and told him that he need not try in
	that way to make up for the loss of his piping
	wages; for he would only tire himself out and get
	sick. But her son answered that he had not felt
	so well for years, and that he was quite able to
	work. In the course of the afternoon, Old Pipes,
	for the first time that day, put his hand in his
	coat pocket, and there, to his amazement, he
	found the little bag of money. &#8220;Well, well!&#8221;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page178" title="178">&nbsp;</a>he exclaimed, &#8220;I am stupid indeed! I really
	thought that I had seen a Dryad; but when I sat
	down by that big oak-tree I must have gone to
	sleep and dreamed it all; and then I came home
	thinking I had given the money to a Dryad, when
	it was in my pocket all the time. But the Chief
	Villager shall have the money. I shall not take
	it to him to-day; but to-morrow I wish to go to
	the village to see some of my old friends, and then
	I shall give up the money.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Toward the close of the afternoon, Old Pipes,
	as had been his custom for so many years, took
	his pipes from the shelf on which they lay, and
	went out to the rock in front of the cottage.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; cried his mother.
	&#8220;If you will not consent to be paid, why do you
	pipe?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am going to pipe for my own pleasure,&#8221;
	said her son. &#8220;I am used to it, and I do not
	wish to give it up. It does not matter now
	whether the cattle hear me or not, and I am sure
	that my piping will injure no one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When the good man began to play upon his
	favorite instrument he was astonished at the
	sound that came from it. The beautiful notes
	of the pipes sounded clear and strong down into
	the valley, and spread over the hills and up the
	sides of the mountain beyond, while, after a little
	interval, an echo came back from the rocky hill on
	the other side of the valley.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page179" title="179">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Ha! ha!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;what has happened to
	my pipes? They must have been stopped up of
	late, but now they are as clear and good as ever.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Again the merry notes went sounding far and
	wide. The cattle on the mountain heard them,
	and those that were old enough remembered how
	these notes had called them from their pastures
	every evening, and so they started down the
	mountain-side, the others following.</p>

	<p>The merry notes were heard in the village
	below, and the people were much astonished
	thereby. &#8220;Why, who can be blowing the pipes
	of Old Pipes?&#8221; they said. But, as they were all
	very busy, no one went up to see. One thing,
	however, was plain enough: the cattle were
	coming down the mountain. And so the two
	boys and the girl did not have to go after them,
	and had an hour for play, for which they were
	very glad.</p>

	<p>The next morning Old Pipes started down to
	the village with his money, and on the way he
	met the Dryad. &#8220;Oh, ho!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;is that
	you? Why, I thought my letting you out of the
	tree was nothing but a dream.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A dream!&#8221; cried the Dryad; &#8220;if you only
	knew how happy you have made me you would
	not think it merely a dream. And has it not
	benefited you? Do you not feel happier? Yesterday
	I heard you playing beautifully on your
	pipes.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page180" title="180">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; cried he. &#8220;I did not understand
	it before, but I see it all now. I have really grown
	younger. I thank you, I thank you, good Dryad,
	from the bottom of my heart. It was the finding
	of the money in my pocket that made me think it
	was a dream.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I put it in when you were asleep,&#8221; she
	said, laughing, &#8220;because I thought you ought to
	keep it. Good-by, kind, honest man. May you
	live long and be as happy as I am now.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Old Pipes was greatly delighted when he understood
	that he was really a younger man; but that
	made no difference about the money, and he kept
	on his way to the village. As soon as he reached
	it he was eagerly questioned as to who had been
	playing his pipes the evening before; and when
	the people heard that it was himself, they were
	very much surprised. Thereupon Old Pipes told
	what had happened to him, and then there was
	greater wonder, with hearty congratulations and
	hand-shakes; for Old Pipes was liked by every
	one. The Chief Villager refused to take his
	money, and, although Old Pipes said that he had
	not earned it, every one present insisted that, as
	he would now play on his pipes as before, he
	should lose nothing because, for a time, he was
	unable to perform his duty.</p>

	<p>So Old Pipes was obliged to keep his money,
	and after an hour or two spent in conversation
	with his friends, he returned to his cottage.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page181" title="181">&nbsp;</a>There was one individual, however, who was
	not at all pleased with what had happened to Old
	Pipes. This was an Echo-dwarf, who lived on
	the hills on the other side of the valley, and
	whose duty it was to echo back the notes of the
	pipes whenever they could be heard. There were
	a great many other Echo-dwarfs on these hills,
	some of whom echoed back the songs of maidens,
	some the shouts of children, and others the music
	that was often heard in the village. But there was
	only one who could send back the strong notes of
	the pipes of Old Pipes, and this had been his sole
	duty for many years. But when the old man grew
	feeble, and the notes of his pipes could not be
	heard on the opposite hills, this Echo-dwarf had
	nothing to do, and he spent his time in delightful
	idleness; and he slept so much and grew so fat
	that it made his companions laugh to see him walk.</p>

	<p>On the afternoon on which, after so long an
	interval, the sound of the pipes was heard on the
	echo-hills, this dwarf was fast asleep behind a
	rock. As soon as the first notes reached them,
	some of his companions ran to wake him. Rolling
	to his feet, he echoed back the merry tune of
	Old Pipes. Naturally he was very much annoyed
	and indignant at being thus obliged to
	give up his life of comfortable leisure, and he
	hoped very much that this pipe-playing would not
	occur again. The next afternoon he was awake
	and listening, and, sure enough, at the usual
	<a class="pagenum" id="page182" title="182">&nbsp;</a>hour, along came the notes of the pipes as clear
	and strong as they ever had been; and he was
	obliged to work as long as Old Pipes played.
	The Echo-dwarf was very angry. He had supposed,
	of course, that the pipe-playing had ceased
	forever, and he felt that he had a right to be indignant
	at being thus deceived. He was so much
	disturbed that he made up his mind to go and try
	to find out whether this was to be a temporary
	matter or not. He had plenty of time, as the
	pipes were played but once a day, and he set off
	early in the morning for the hill on which Old
	Pipes lived. It was hard work for the fat little
	fellow, and when he had crossed the valley and
	had gone some distance into the woods on the
	hillside, he stopped to rest, and in a few minutes
	the Dryad came tripping along.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; exclaimed the dwarf; &#8220;what are
	you doing here? and how did you get out of your
	tree?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Doing!&#8221; cried the Dryad, &#8220;I am being
	happy; that&#8217;s what I am doing. And I was let
	out of my tree by a good old man who plays the
	pipes to call the cattle down from the mountain.
	And it makes me happier to think that I have
	been of service to him. I gave him two kisses of
	gratitude, and now he is young enough to play
	his pipes as well as ever.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The Echo-dwarf stepped forward, his face pale
	with passion. &#8220;Am I to believe,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page183" title="183">&nbsp;</a>you are the cause of this great evil that has come
	upon me? and that you are the wicked creature
	who has again started this old man upon his
	career of pipe-playing? What have I ever done
	to you that you should have condemned me for
	years and years to echo back the notes of those
	wretched pipes?&#8221;</p>

	<p>At this the Dryad laughed loudly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What a funny little fellow you are!&#8221; she said.
	&#8220;Any one would think you had been condemned
	to toil from morning till night; while what you
	really have to do is merely to imitate for half an
	hour every day the merry notes of Old Pipes&#8217;s
	piping. Fie upon you, Echo-dwarf! You are
	lazy and selfish; and that is what is the matter
	with you. Instead of grumbling at being obliged
	to do a little wholesome work&#8212;which is less, I
	am sure, than that of any other Echo-dwarf upon
	the rocky hillside&#8212;you should rejoice at the
	good fortune of the old man who has regained so
	much of his strength and vigor. Go home and
	learn to be just and generous; and then, perhaps,
	you may be happy. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Insolent creature!&#8221; shouted the dwarf, as he
	shook his fat little fist at her. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make you
	suffer for this. You shall find out what it is to
	heap injury and insult upon one like me, and to
	snatch from him the repose that he has earned
	by long years of toil.&#8221; And, shaking his head
	savagely, he hurried back to the rocky hillside.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page184" title="184">&nbsp;</a>Every afternoon the merry notes of the pipes of
	Old Pipes sounded down into the valley and over
	the hills and up the mountain-side; and every
	afternoon when he had echoed them back, the
	little dwarf grew more and more angry with the
	Dryad. Each day, from early morning till it was
	time for him to go back to his duties upon the
	rocky hillside, he searched the woods for her.
	He intended, if he met her, to pretend to be very
	sorry for what he had said, and he thought he
	might be able to play a trick upon her which
	would avenge him well. One day, while thus
	wandering among the trees, he met Old Pipes.
	The Echo-dwarf did not generally care to see
	or speak to ordinary people; but now he was so
	anxious to find the object of his search that he
	stopped and asked Old Pipes if he had seen the
	Dryad. The piper had not noticed the little
	fellow, and he looked down on him with some
	surprise.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have not seen her, and I
	have been looking everywhere for her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; cried the dwarf; &#8220;what do you wish
	with her?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Old Pipes then sat down on a stone, so that
	he should be nearer the ear of his small companion,
	and he told what the Dryad had done for
	him.</p>

	<p>When the Echo-dwarf heard that this was the
	man whose pipes he was obliged to echo back
	<a class="pagenum" id="page185" title="185">&nbsp;</a>every day, he would have slain him on the spot
	had he been able; but, as he was not able, he
	merely ground his teeth and listened to the rest
	of the story.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am looking for the Dryad now,&#8221; Old Pipes
	continued, &#8220;on account of my aged mother.
	When I was old myself, I did not notice how
	very old my mother was; but now it shocks me
	to see how feeble and decrepit her years have
	caused her to become; and I am looking for the
	Dryad to ask her to make my mother younger, as
	she made me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The eyes of the Echo-dwarf glistened. Here
	was a man who might help him in his plans.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Your idea is a good one,&#8221; he said to Old
	Pipes, &#8220;and it does you honor. But you should
	know that a Dryad can make no person younger
	but one who lets her out of her tree. However,
	you can manage the affair very easily. All you
	need do is to find the Dryad, tell her what you
	want, and request her to step into her tree and be
	shut up for a short time. Then you will go and
	bring your mother to the tree; she will open it,
	and everything will be as you wish. Is not this
	a good plan?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; cried Old Pipes; &#8220;and I will
	go instantly and search more diligently for the
	Dryad.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Take me with you,&#8221; said the Echo-dwarf.
	&#8220;You can easily carry me on your strong shoulders;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page186" title="186">&nbsp;</a>and I shall be glad to help you in any way
	that I can.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now, then,&#8221; said the little fellow to himself,
	as Old Pipes carried him rapidly along, &#8220;if he
	persuades the Dryad to get into a tree&#8212;and she
	is quite foolish enough to do it&#8212;and then goes
	away to bring his mother, I shall take a stone or
	a club and I will break off the key of that tree,
	so that nobody can ever turn it again. Then
	Mistress Dryad will see what she has brought
	upon herself by her behavior to me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Before long they came to the great oak-tree in
	which the Dryad had lived, and, at a distance,
	they saw that beautiful creature herself coming
	toward them.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How excellently well everything happens!&#8221;
	said the dwarf. &#8220;Put me down, and I will go.
	Your business with the Dryad is more important
	than mine; and you need not say anything about
	my having suggested your plan to you. I am
	willing that you should have all the credit of it
	yourself.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Old Pipes put the Echo-dwarf upon the ground,
	but the little rogue did not go away. He concealed
	himself between some low, mossy rocks,
	and he was so much of their color that you would
	not have noticed him if you had been looking
	straight at him.</p>

	<p>When the Dryad came up, Old Pipes lost no
	time in telling her about his mother, and what
	<a class="pagenum" id="page187" title="187">&nbsp;</a>he wished her to do. At first the Dryad answered
	nothing, but stood looking very sadly at Old
	Pipes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Do you really wish me to go into my tree
	again?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I should dreadfully dislike
	to do it, for I don&#8217;t know what might happen.
	It is not at all necessary, for I could make your
	mother younger at any time if she would give me
	the opportunity. I had already thought of making
	you still happier in this way, and several
	times I have waited about your cottage, hoping
	to meet your aged mother; but she never comes
	outside, and you know a Dryad cannot enter a
	house. I cannot imagine what put this idea
	into your head. Did you think of it yourself?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, I cannot say that I did,&#8221; answered Old
	Pipes. &#8220;A little dwarf whom I met in the woods
	proposed it to me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried the Dryad, &#8220;now I see through
	it all. It is the scheme of that vile Echo-dwarf&#8212;your
	enemy and mine. Where is he? I should
	like to see him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I think he has gone away,&#8221; said Old Pipes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, he has not,&#8221; said the Dryad, whose
	quick eyes perceived the Echo-dwarf among the
	rocks. &#8220;There he is. Seize him and drag him
	out, I beg of you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Old Pipes perceived the dwarf as soon as he
	was pointed out to him, and, running to the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page188" title="188">&nbsp;</a>rocks, he caught the little fellow by the arm and
	pulled him out.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now, then,&#8221; cried the Dryad, who had
	opened the door of the great oak, &#8220;just stick
	him in there and we will shut him <ins id="ins3" class="correction" title="no">up</ins>. Then I
	shall be safe from his mischief for the rest of the
	time I am free.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Old Pipes thrust the Echo-dwarf into the tree;
	the Dryad pushed the door shut; there was a
	clicking sound of bark and wood, and no one
	would have noticed that the big oak had ever had
	an opening in it.</p>

	<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; said the Dryad; &#8220;now we need not
	be afraid of him. And I assure you, my good
	piper, that I shall be very glad to make your
	mother younger as soon as I can. Will you not
	ask her to come out and meet me?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course I will,&#8221; cried Old Pipes; &#8220;and I
	will do it without delay.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And then, the Dryad by his side, he hurried to
	his cottage. But when he mentioned the matter
	to his mother, the old woman became very angry
	indeed. She did not believe in Dryads; and, if
	they really did exist, she knew they must be
	witches and sorceresses, and she would have
	nothing to do with them. If her son had ever
	allowed himself to be kissed by one of them, he
	ought to be ashamed of himself. As to its doing
	him the least bit of good, she did not believe a
	word of it. He felt better than he used to feel,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page189" title="189">&nbsp;</a>but that was very common; she had sometimes
	felt that way herself. And she forbade him ever
	to mention a Dryad to her again.</p>

	<p>That afternoon Old Pipes, feeling very sad that
	his plan in regard to his mother had failed, sat
	down upon the rock and played upon his pipes.
	The pleasant sounds went down the valley and up
	the hills and mountain, but, to the great surprise
	of some persons who happened to notice the fact,
	the notes were not echoed back from the rocky
	hillside, but from the woods on the side of the
	valley on which Old Pipes lived. The next day
	many of the villagers stopped in their work to
	listen to the echo of the pipes coming from the
	woods. The sound was not as clear and strong
	as it used to be when it was sent back from the
	rocky hillside, but it certainly came from among
	the trees. Such a thing as an echo changing its
	place in this way had never been heard of before,
	and nobody was able to explain how it could have
	happened. Old Pipes, however, knew very well
	that the sound came from the Echo-dwarf shut up
	in the great oak-tree. The sides of the tree were
	thin, and the sound of the pipes could be heard
	through them, and the dwarf was obliged by the
	laws of his being to echo back those notes whenever
	they came to him. But Old Pipes thought
	he might get the Dryad in trouble if he let any
	one know that the Echo-dwarf was shut up in
	the tree, and so he wisely said nothing about it.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page190" title="190">&nbsp;</a>One day the two boys and the girl who had
	helped Old Pipes up the hill were playing in the
	woods. Stopping near the great oak-tree, they
	heard a sound of knocking within it, and then a
	voice plainly said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Let me out! let me out!&#8221;</p>

	<p>For a moment the children stood still in astonishment,
	and then one of the boys exclaimed:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, it is a Dryad, like the one Old Pipes
	found! Let&#8217;s let her out!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What are you thinking of?&#8221; cried the girl.
	&#8220;I am the oldest of all, and I am only thirteen.
	Do you wish to be turned into crawling babies?
	Run! run! run!&#8221;</p>

	<p>And the two boys and the girl dashed down
	into the valley as fast as their legs could carry
	them. There was no desire in their youthful
	hearts to be made younger than they were. And
	for fear that their parents might think it well that
	they should commence their careers anew, they
	never said a word about finding the Dryad-tree.</p>

	<p>As the summer days went on Old Pipes&#8217;s
	mother grew feebler and feebler. One day when
	her son was away&#8212;for he now frequently went
	into the woods to hunt or fish, or down into the
	valley to work&#8212;she arose from her knitting to
	prepare the simple dinner. But she felt so weak
	and tired that she was not able to do the work to
	which she had been so long accustomed. &#8220;Alas!
	alas!&#8221; she said, &#8220;the time has come when I am
	<a class="pagenum" id="page191" title="191">&nbsp;</a>too old to work. My son will have to hire some
	one to come here and cook his meals, make his
	bed, and mend his clothes. Alas! alas! I had
	hoped that as long as I lived I should be able to
	do these things. But it is not so. I have grown
	utterly worthless, and some one else must prepare
	the dinner for my son. I wonder where he
	is.&#8221; And tottering to the door, she went outside
	to look for him. She did not feel able to stand,
	and reaching the rustic chair, she sank into it,
	quite exhausted, and soon fell asleep.</p>

	<p>The Dryad, who had often come to the cottage
	to see if she could find an opportunity of carrying
	out Old Pipes&#8217;s affectionate design, now happened
	by; and seeing that the much-desired occasion
	had come, she stepped up quietly behind the old
	woman and gently kissed her on each cheek, and
	then as quietly disappeared.</p>

	<p>In a few minutes the mother of Old Pipes
	awoke, and looking up at the sun, she exclaimed,
	&#8220;Why, it is almost dinner-time! My son will
	be here directly, and I am not ready for him.&#8221;
	And rising to her feet, she hurried into the house,
	made the fire, set the meat and vegetables to cook,
	laid the cloth, and by the time her son arrived the
	meal was on the table.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How a little sleep does refresh one!&#8221; she
	said to herself, as she was bustling about. She
	was a woman of very vigorous constitution, and
	at seventy had been a great deal stronger and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page192" title="192">&nbsp;</a>more active than her son was at that age. The
	moment Old Pipes saw his mother, he knew that
	the Dryad had been there; but, while he felt as
	happy as a king, he was too wise to say anything
	about her.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is astonishing how well I feel to-day,&#8221; said
	his mother; &#8220;and either my hearing has improved
	or you speak much more plainly than you have
	done of late.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The summer days went on and passed away,
	the leaves were falling from the trees, and the air
	was becoming cold.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Nature has ceased to be lovely,&#8221; said the
	Dryad, &#8220;and the night winds chill me. It is
	time for me to go back into my comfortable
	quarters in the great oak. But first I must pay
	another visit to the cottage of Old Pipes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>She found the piper and his mother sitting side
	by side on the rock in front of the door. The
	cattle were not to go to the mountain any more
	that season, and he was piping them down for
	the last time. Loud and merrily sounded the
	pipes of Old Pipes, and down the mountain-side
	came the cattle, the cows by the easiest paths,
	the sheep by those not quite so easy, and the
	goats by the most difficult ones among the rocks;
	while from the great oak-tree were heard the
	echoes of the cheerful music.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How happy they look, sitting there together!&#8221;
	said the Dryad; &#8220;and I don&#8217;t believe it will do
	<a class="pagenum" id="page193" title="193">&nbsp;</a>them a bit of harm to be still younger.&#8221; And
	moving quietly up behind them, she first kissed
	Old Pipes on his cheek and then his mother.</p>

	<p>Old Pipes, who had stopped playing, knew
	what it was, but he did not move, and said nothing.
	His mother, thinking that her son had
	kissed her, turned to him with a smile and kissed
	him in return. And then she arose and went into
	the cottage, a vigorous woman of sixty, followed
	by her son, erect and happy, and twenty years
	younger than herself.</p>

	<p>The Dryad sped away to the woods, shrugging
	her shoulders as she felt the cool evening
	wind.</p>

	<p>When she reached the great oak, she turned
	the key and opened the door. &#8220;Come out,&#8221;
	she said to the Echo-dwarf, who sat blinking
	within. &#8220;Winter is coming on, and I want the
	comfortable shelter of my tree for myself. The
	cattle have come down from the mountain for the
	last time this year, the pipes will no longer
	sound, and you can go to your rocks and have a
	holiday until next spring.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Upon hearing these words the dwarf skipped
	quickly out, and the Dryad entered the tree and
	pulled the door shut after her. &#8220;Now, then,&#8221;
	she said to herself, &#8220;he can break off the key if
	he likes. It does not matter to me. Another
	will grow out next spring. And although the
	good piper made me no promise, I know that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page194" title="194">&nbsp;</a>when the warm days arrive next year he will
	come and let me out again.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The Echo-dwarf did not stop to break the key
	of the tree. He was too happy to be released to
	think of anything else, and he hastened as fast as
	he could to his home on the rocky hillside.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">The Dryad was not mistaken when she trusted
	in the piper. When the warm days came again
	he went to the oak-tree to let her out. But, to
	his sorrow and surprise, he found the great tree
	lying upon the ground. A winter storm had
	blown it down, and it lay with its trunk shattered
	and split. And what became of the Dryad no
	one ever knew.</p>

	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> country residence of Mr. John
	Hinckman was a delightful place to
	me, for many reasons. It was the
	abode of a genial, though somewhat
	impulsive, hospitality. It had broad, smooth-shaven
	lawns and towering oaks and elms; there
	were bosky shades at several points, and not far
	from the house there was a little rill spanned by
	a rustic bridge with the bark on; there were
	fruits and flowers, pleasant people, chess, billiards,
	rides, walks, and fishing. These were
	great attractions; but none of them, nor all of
	them together, would have been sufficient to
	hold me to the place very long. I had been
	invited for the trout season, but should probably
	have finished my visit early in the summer had it
	not been that upon fair days, when the grass was
	dry, and the sun was not too hot, and there was
	but little wind, there strolled beneath the lofty
	<a class="pagenum" id="page198" title="198">&nbsp;</a>elms, or passed lightly through the bosky shades,
	the form of my Madeline.</p>

	<p>This lady was not, in very truth, my Madeline.
	She had never given herself to me, nor had I, in
	any way, acquired possession of her. But as I
	considered her possession the only sufficient reason
	for the continuance of my existence, I called
	her, in my reveries, mine. It may have been
	that I would not have been obliged to confine the
	use of this possessive pronoun to my reveries
	had I confessed the state of my feelings to the
	lady.</p>

	<p>But this was an unusually difficult thing to do.
	Not only did I dread, as almost all lovers dread,
	taking the step which would in an instant put an
	end to that delightful season which may be termed
	the ante-interrogatory period of love, and which
	might at the same time terminate all intercourse
	or connection with the object of my passion, but
	I was also dreadfully afraid of John Hinckman.
	This gentleman was a good friend of mine, but
	it would have required a bolder man than I was
	at that time to ask him for the gift of his niece,
	who was the head of his household, and, according
	to his own frequent statement, the main prop
	of his declining years. Had Madeline acquiesced
	in my general views on the subject, I might have
	felt encouraged to open the matter to Mr. Hinckman;
	but, as I said before, I had never asked her
	whether or not she would be mine. I thought of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page199" title="199">&nbsp;</a>these things at all hours of the day and night,
	particularly the latter.</p>

	<p>I was lying awake one night, in the great bed
	in my spacious chamber, when, by the dim light
	of the new moon, which partially filled the room,
	I saw John Hinckman standing by a large chair
	near the door. I was very much surprised at this,
	for two reasons. In the first place, my host had
	never before come into my room; and, in the
	second place, he had gone from home that morning,
	and had not expected to return for several
	days. It was for this reason that I had been
	able that evening to sit much later than usual
	with Madeline on the moon-lit porch. The figure
	was certainly that of John Hinckman in his ordinary
	dress, but there was a vagueness and indistinctness
	about it which presently assured me
	that it was a ghost. Had the good old man been
	murdered? and had his spirit come to tell me of
	the deed, and to confide to me the protection of
	his dear&#8212;? My heart fluttered at what I was
	about to think, but at this instant the figure
	spoke.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he said, with a countenance
	that indicated anxiety, &#8220;if Mr. Hinckman will
	return to-night?&#8221;</p>

	<p>I thought it well to maintain a calm exterior,
	and I answered:</p>

	<p>&#8220;We do not expect him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am glad of that,&#8221; said he, sinking into the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page200" title="200">&nbsp;</a>chair by which he stood. &#8220;During the two years
	and a half that I have inhabited this house, that
	man has never before been away for a single
	night. You can&#8217;t imagine the relief it gives me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And as he spoke he stretched out his legs and
	leaned back in the chair. His form became less
	vague, and the colors of his garments more distinct
	and evident, while an expression of gratified
	relief succeeded to the anxiety of his countenance.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Two years and a half!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;I
	don&#8217;t understand you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is fully that length of time,&#8221; said the
	ghost, &#8220;since I first came here. Mine is not an
	ordinary case. But before I say anything more
	about it, let me ask you again if you are sure Mr.
	Hinckman will not return to-night?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am as sure of it as I can be of anything,&#8221;
	I answered. &#8220;He left to-day for Bristol, two
	hundred miles away.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then I will go on,&#8221; said the ghost, &#8220;for I
	am glad to have the opportunity of talking to
	some one who will listen to me; but if John
	Hinckman should come in and catch me here I
	should be frightened out of my wits.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;This is all very strange,&#8221; I said, greatly
	puzzled by what I had heard. &#8220;Are you the
	ghost of Mr. Hinckman?&#8221;</p>

	<p>This was a bold question, but my mind was so
	full of other emotions that there seemed to be no
	room for that of fear.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page201" title="201">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Yes, I am his ghost,&#8221; my companion replied,
	&#8220;and yet I have no right to be. And this is what
	makes me so uneasy, and so much afraid of him.
	It is a strange story, and, I truly believe, without
	precedent. Two years and a half ago John Hinckman
	was dangerously ill in this very room. At
	one time he was so far gone that he was really
	believed to be dead. It was in consequence of
	too precipitate a report in regard to this matter
	that I was, at that time, appointed to be his
	ghost. Imagine my surprise and horror, sir,
	when, after I had accepted the position and assumed
	its responsibilities, that old man revived,
	became convalescent, and eventually regained his
	usual health. My situation was now one of extreme
	delicacy and embarrassment. I had no
	power to return to my original unembodiment,
	and I had no right to be the ghost of a man who
	was not dead. I was advised by my friends to
	quietly maintain my position, and was assured
	that, as John Hinckman was an elderly man, it
	could not be long before I could rightfully assume
	the position for which I had been selected.
	But I tell you, sir,&#8221; he continued, with animation,
	&#8220;the old fellow seems as vigorous as ever, and I
	have no idea how much longer this annoying state
	of things will continue. I spend my time trying
	to get out of that old man&#8217;s way. I must not
	leave this house, and he seems to follow me
	everywhere. I tell you, sir, he haunts me.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page202" title="202">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;That is truly a queer state of things,&#8221; I remarked.
	&#8220;But why are you afraid of him? He
	couldn&#8217;t hurt you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course he couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said the ghost. &#8220;But
	his very presence is a shock and terror to me.
	Imagine, sir, how you would feel if my case were
	yours.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I could not imagine such a thing at all. I
	simply shuddered.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And if one must be a wrongful ghost at all,&#8221;
	the apparition continued, &#8220;it would be much
	pleasanter to be the ghost of some man other
	than John Hinckman. There is in him an irascibility
	of temper, accompanied by a facility of
	invective, which is seldom met with. And what
	would happen if he were to see me, and find out,
	as I am sure he would, how long and why I had
	inhabited his house, I can scarcely conceive. I
	have seen him in his bursts of passion; and, although
	he did not hurt the people he stormed at
	any more than he would hurt me, they seemed to
	shrink before him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>All this I knew to be very true. Had it not
	been for this peculiarity of Mr. Hinckman I
	might have been more willing to talk to him about
	his niece.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I feel sorry for you,&#8221; I said, for I really began
	to have a sympathetic feeling toward this unfortunate
	apparition. &#8220;Your case is indeed a hard
	one. It reminds me of those persons who have
	<a class="pagenum" id="page203" title="203">&nbsp;</a>had doubles, and I suppose a man would often be
	very angry indeed when he found that there was
	another being who was personating himself.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, the cases are not similar at all,&#8221; said
	the ghost. &#8220;A double or doppelgänger lives on
	the earth with a man, and, being exactly like
	him, he makes all sorts of trouble, of course. It
	is very different with me. I am not here to live
	with Mr. Hinckman. I am here to take his
	place. Now, it would make John Hinckman
	very angry if he knew that. Don&#8217;t you know it
	would?&#8221;</p>

	<p>I assented promptly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now that he is away I can be easy for a little
	while,&#8221; continued the ghost; &#8220;and I am so glad
	to have an opportunity of talking to you. I have
	frequently come into your room and watched you
	while you slept, but did not dare to speak to you
	for fear that if you talked with me Mr. Hinckman
	would hear you and come into the room to know
	why you were talking to yourself.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But would he not hear you?&#8221; I asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; said the other; &#8220;there are times
	when any one may see me, but no one hears me
	except the person to whom I address myself.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But why did you wish to speak to me?&#8221; I
	asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; replied the ghost, &#8220;I like occasionally
	to talk to people, and especially to some
	one like yourself, whose mind is so troubled and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page204" title="204">&nbsp;</a>perturbed that you are not likely to be frightened
	by a visit from one of us. But I particularly
	wanted to ask you to do me a favor. There is
	every probability, so far as I can see, that John
	Hinckman will live a long time, and my situation
	is becoming insupportable. My great object at
	present is to get myself transferred, and I think
	that you may, perhaps, be of use to me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Transferred!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;What do you
	mean by that?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What I mean,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;is this: now
	that I have started on my career I have got to be
	the ghost of somebody, and I want to be the
	ghost of a man who is really dead.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I should think that would be easy enough,&#8221; I
	said. &#8220;Opportunities must continually occur.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Not at all! not at all!&#8221; said my companion,
	quickly. &#8220;You have no idea what a rush and
	pressure there is for situations of this kind.
	Whenever a vacancy occurs, if I may express
	myself in that way, there are crowds of applications
	for the ghostship.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I had no idea that such a state of things
	existed,&#8221; I said, becoming quite interested in the
	matter. &#8220;There ought to be some regular system,
	or order of precedence, by which you could
	all take your turns like customers in a barber&#8217;s
	shop.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh dear, that would never do at all!&#8221; said
	the other. &#8220;Some of us would have to wait forever.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page205" title="205">&nbsp;</a>There is always a great rush whenever a
	good ghostship offers itself&#8212;while, as you know,
	there are some positions that no one would care
	for. And it was in consequence of my being in
	too great a hurry on an occasion of the kind that
	I got myself into my present disagreeable predicament,
	and I have thought that it might be possible
	that you would help me out of it. You might
	know of a case where an opportunity for a ghostship
	was not generally expected, but which might
	present itself at any moment. If you would give
	me a short notice I know I could arrange for a
	transfer.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;Do
	you want me to commit suicide? or to undertake
	a murder for your benefit?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh no, no, no!&#8221; said the other, with a vapory
	smile. &#8220;I mean nothing of that kind. To be
	sure, there are lovers who are watched with considerable
	interest, such persons having been
	known, in moments of depression, to offer very
	desirable ghostships; but I did not think of anything
	of that kind in connection with you. You
	were the only person I cared to speak to, and I
	hoped that you might give me some information
	that would be of use; and, in return, I shall be
	very glad to help you in your love-affair.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You seem to know that I have such an
	affair,&#8221; I said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh yes!&#8221; replied the other, with a little
	<a class="pagenum" id="page206" title="206">&nbsp;</a>yawn. &#8220;I could not be here so much as I have
	been without knowing all about that.&#8221;</p>

	<p>There was something horrible in the idea of
	Madeline and myself having been watched by a
	ghost, even, perhaps, when we wandered together
	in the most delightful and bosky places.
	But then this was quite an exceptional ghost, and
	I could not have the objections to him which
	would ordinarily arise in regard to beings of his
	class.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I must go now,&#8221; said the ghost, rising, &#8220;but
	I will see you somewhere to-morrow night. And
	remember&#8212;you help me and I&#8217;ll help you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I had doubts the next morning as to the propriety
	of telling Madeline anything about this interview,
	and soon convinced myself that I must
	keep silent on the subject. If she knew there
	was a ghost about the house she would probably
	leave the place instantly. I did not mention the
	matter, and so regulated my demeanor that I am
	quite sure Madeline never suspected what had
	taken place. For some time I had wished that
	Mr. Hinckman would absent himself, for a day
	at least, from the premises. In such case I
	thought I might more easily nerve myself up to
	the point of speaking to Madeline on the subject
	of our future collateral existence; and, now that
	the opportunity for such speech had really occurred,
	I did not feel ready to avail myself of it.
	What would become of me if she refused me?</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page207" title="207">&nbsp;</a>I had an idea, however, that the lady thought
	that, if I were going to speak at all, this was the
	time. She must have known that certain sentiments
	were afloat within me, and she was not unreasonable
	in her wish to see the matter settled
	one way or the other. But I did not feel like
	taking a bold step in the dark. If she wished
	me to ask her to give herself to me she ought to
	offer me some reason to suppose that she would
	make the gift. If I saw no probability of such
	generosity I would prefer that things should
	remain as they were.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">That evening I was sitting with Madeline in
	the moon-lit porch. It was nearly ten o&#8217;clock,
	and ever since supper-time I had been working
	myself up to the point of making an avowal of
	my sentiments. I had not positively determined
	to do this, but wished gradually to reach the
	proper point, when, if the prospect looked bright,
	I might speak. My companion appeared to understand
	the situation&#8212;at least I imagined that the
	nearer I came to a proposal the more she seemed
	to expect it. It was certainly a very critical and
	important epoch in my life. If I spoke I should
	make myself happy or miserable forever; and if
	I did not speak I had every reason to believe that
	the lady would not give me another chance to
	do so.</p>

	<p>Sitting thus with Madeline, talking a little, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page208" title="208">&nbsp;</a>thinking very hard over these momentous matters,
	I looked up and saw the ghost not a dozen feet
	away from us. He was sitting on the railing of
	the porch, one leg thrown up before him, the
	other dangling down as he leaned against a post.
	He was behind Madeline, but almost in front of
	me, as I sat facing the lady. It was fortunate
	that Madeline was looking out over the landscape,
	for I must have appeared very much startled.
	The ghost had told me that he would see me
	sometime this night, but I did not think he would
	make his appearance when I was in the company
	of Madeline. If she should see the spirit of her
	uncle I could not answer for the consequences.
	I made no exclamation, but the ghost evidently
	saw that I was troubled.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I shall not let
	her see me; and she cannot hear me speak unless
	I address myself to her, which I do not intend
	to do.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I suppose I looked grateful.</p>

	<p>&#8220;So you need not trouble yourself about that,&#8221;
	the ghost continued; &#8220;but it seems to me that
	you are not getting along very well with your
	affair. If I were you I should speak out without
	waiting any longer. You will never have a
	better chance. You are not likely to be interrupted;
	and, so far as I can judge, the lady
	seems disposed to listen to you favorably; that
	is, if she ever intends to do so. There is no
	<a class="pagenum" id="page209" title="209">&nbsp;</a>knowing when John Hinckman will go away
	again; certainly not this summer. If I were in
	your place I should never dare to make love to
	Hinckman&#8217;s niece if he were anywhere about the
	place. If he should catch any one offering himself
	to Miss Madeline he would then be a terrible
	man to encounter.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I agreed perfectly to all this.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I cannot bear to think of him!&#8221; I ejaculated
	aloud.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Think of whom?&#8221; asked Madeline, turning
	quickly toward me.</p>

	<p>Here was an awkward situation. The long
	speech of the ghost, to which Madeline paid no
	attention, but which I heard with perfect distinctness,
	had made me forget myself.</p>

	<p>It was necessary to explain quickly. Of course
	it would not do to admit that it was of her dear
	uncle that I was speaking; and so I mentioned
	hastily the first name I thought of.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mr. Vilars,&#8221; I said.</p>

	<p>This statement was entirely correct; for I
	never could bear to think of Mr. Vilars, who was
	a gentleman who had at various times paid much
	attention to Madeline.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is wrong for you to speak in that way of
	Mr. Vilars,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He is a remarkably
	well-educated and sensible young man, and has
	very pleasant manners. He expects to be elected
	to the legislature this fall, and I should not be
	<a class="pagenum" id="page210" title="210">&nbsp;</a>surprised if he made his mark. He will do well
	in a legislative body, for whenever Mr. Vilars has
	anything to say he knows just how and when to
	say it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>This was spoken very quietly and without any
	show of resentment, which was all very natural;
	for if Madeline thought at all favorably of me she
	could not feel displeased that I should have disagreeable
	emotions in regard to a possible rival.
	The concluding words contained a hint which I
	was not slow to understand. I felt very sure
	that if Mr. Vilars were in my present position he
	would speak quickly enough.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I know it is wrong to have such ideas about
	a person,&#8221; I said, &#8220;but I cannot help it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The lady did not chide me, and after this she
	seemed even in a softer mood. As for me, I felt
	considerably annoyed, for I had not wished to
	admit that any thought of Mr. Vilars had ever
	occupied my mind.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You should not speak aloud that way,&#8221; said
	the ghost, &#8220;or you may get yourself into trouble.
	I want to see everything go well with you, because
	then you may be disposed to help me,
	especially if I should chance to be of any assistance
	to you, which I hope I shall be.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I longed to tell him that there was no way in
	which he could help me so much as by taking his
	instant departure. To make love to a young lady
	with a ghost sitting on the railing near by, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page211" title="211">&nbsp;</a>that ghost the apparition of a much-dreaded uncle,
	the very idea of whom in such a position and at
	such a time made me tremble, was a difficult, if
	not an impossible, thing to do; but I forbore to
	speak, although I may have looked, my mind.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; continued the ghost, &#8220;that you
	have not heard anything that might be of advantage
	to me. Of course I am very anxious to hear;
	but if you have anything to tell me I can wait
	until you are alone. I will come to you to-night
	in your room, or I will stay here until the lady
	goes away.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You need not wait here,&#8221; I said; &#8220;I have
	nothing at all to say to you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Madeline sprang to her feet, her face flushed
	and her eyes ablaze.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Wait here!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;What do you suppose
	I am waiting for? Nothing to say to me
	indeed!&#8212;I should think so! What should you
	have to say to me?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Madeline,&#8221; I exclaimed, stepping toward her,
	&#8220;let me explain.&#8221;</p>

	<p>But she had gone.</p>

	<p>Here was the end of the world for me! I
	turned fiercely to the ghost.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Wretched existence!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;You have
	ruined everything. You have blackened my whole
	life. Had it not been for you&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>But here my voice faltered. I could say no
	more.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page212" title="212">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;You wrong me,&#8221; said the ghost. &#8220;I have
	not injured you. I have tried only to encourage
	and assist you, and it is your own folly that has
	done this mischief. But do not despair. Such
	mistakes as these can be explained. Keep up a
	brave heart. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And he vanished from the railing like a bursting
	soap-bubble.</p>

	<p>I went gloomily to bed, but I saw no apparitions
	that night except those of despair and
	misery which my wretched thoughts called up.
	The words I had uttered had sounded to Madeline
	like the basest insult. Of course there was
	only one interpretation she could put upon them.</p>

	<p>As to explaining my ejaculations, that was impossible.
	I thought the matter over and over
	again as I lay awake that night, and I determined
	that I would never tell Madeline the facts of the
	case. It would be better for me to suffer all my
	life than for her to know that the ghost of her
	uncle haunted the house. Mr. Hinckman was
	away, and if she knew of his ghost she could not
	be made to believe that he was not dead. She
	might not survive the shock! No, my heart
	could bleed, but I would never tell her.</p>

	<p>The next day was fine, neither too cool nor too
	warm; the breezes were gentle, and Nature
	smiled. But there were no walks or rides with
	Madeline. She seemed to be much engaged
	during the day, and I saw but little of her.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page213" title="213">&nbsp;</a>When we met at meals she was polite, but very
	quiet and reserved. She had evidently determined
	on a course of conduct, and had resolved to assume
	that, although I had been very rude to her, she
	did not understand the import of my words. It
	would be quite proper, of course, for her not to
	know what I meant by my expressions of the
	night before.</p>

	<p>I was downcast and wretched and said but little,
	and the only bright streak across the black horizon
	of my woe was the fact that she did not appear to
	be happy, although she affected an air of unconcern.
	The moon-lit porch was deserted that
	evening, but wandering about the house, I found
	Madeline in the library alone. She was reading,
	but I went in and sat down near her. I felt that,
	although I could not do so fully, I must in a
	measure explain my conduct of the night before.
	She listened quietly to a somewhat labored
	apology I made for the words I had used.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have not the slightest idea what you
	meant,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but you were very rude.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I earnestly disclaimed any intention of rudeness,
	and assured her, with a warmth of speech
	that must have made some impression upon her,
	that rudeness to her would be an action impossible
	to me. I said a great deal upon the subject,
	and implored her to believe that if it were not for
	a certain obstacle I could speak to her so plainly
	that she would understand everything.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page214" title="214">&nbsp;</a>She was silent for a time, and then she said,
	rather more kindly, I thought, than she had
	spoken before:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Is that obstacle in any way connected with
	my uncle?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered, after a little hesitation,
	&#8220;it is, in a measure, connected with him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>She made no answer to this, and sat looking at
	her book, but not reading. From the expression
	of her face I thought she was somewhat softened
	toward me. She knew her uncle as well as I
	did, and she may have been thinking that, if
	he were the obstacle that prevented my speaking
	(and there were many ways in which he might be
	that obstacle), my position would be such a hard
	one that it would excuse some wildness of speech
	and eccentricity of manner. I saw, too, that the
	warmth of my partial explanations had had some
	effect on her, and I began to believe that it might
	be a good thing for me to speak my mind without
	delay. No matter how she should receive
	my proposition, my relations with her could not
	be worse than they had been the previous night
	and day, and there was something in her face
	which encouraged me to hope that she might
	forget my foolish exclamations of the evening
	before if I began to tell her my tale of love.</p>

	<p>I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and as
	I did so the ghost burst into the room from the
	doorway behind her. I say burst, although no
	<a class="pagenum" id="page215" title="215">&nbsp;</a>door flew open and he made no noise. He was
	wildly excited, and waved his arms above his
	head. The moment I saw him my heart fell
	within me. With the entrance of that impertinent
	apparition every hope fled from me. I
	could not speak while he was in the room.</p>

	<p>I must have turned pale; and I gazed steadfastly
	at the ghost, almost without seeing Madeline,
	who sat between us.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;that John Hinckman
	is coming up the hill? He will be here in
	fifteen minutes; and if you are doing anything in
	the way of love-making you had better hurry it
	up. But this is not what I came to tell you. I
	have glorious news! At last I am transferred!
	Not forty minutes ago a Russian nobleman was
	murdered by the Nihilists. Nobody ever thought
	of him in connection with an immediate ghostship.
	My friends instantly applied for the situation for
	me, and obtained my transfer. I am off before
	that horrid Hinckman comes up the hill. The
	moment I reach my new position I shall put
	off this hated semblance. Good-by. You can&#8217;t
	imagine how glad I am to be, at last, the real
	ghost of somebody.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; I cried, rising to my feet, and stretching
	out my arms in utter wretchedness, &#8220;I would
	to Heaven you were mine!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I <em>am</em> yours,&#8221; said Madeline, raising to me
	her tearful eyes.</p>

	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">In</span> a certain summer, not long gone, my
	friend Bentley and I found ourselves
	in a little hamlet which overlooked a
	placid valley, through which a river
	gently moved, winding its way through green
	stretches until it turned the end of a line of low
	hills and was lost to view. Beyond this river,
	far away, but visible from the door of the cottage
	where we dwelt, there lay a city. Through the
	mists which floated over the valley we could see
	the outlines of steeples and tall roofs; and buildings
	of a character which indicated thrift and
	business stretched themselves down to the opposite
	edge of the river. The more distant parts
	of the city, evidently a small one, lost themselves
	in the hazy summer atmosphere.</p>

	<p>Bentley was young, fair-haired, and a poet; I
	was a philosopher, or trying to be one. We
	<a class="pagenum" id="page220" title="220">&nbsp;</a>were good friends, and had come down into this
	peaceful region to work together. Although we
	had fled from the bustle and distractions of the
	town, the appearance in this rural region of a city,
	which, so far as we could observe, exerted no influence
	on the quiet character of the valley in
	which it lay, aroused our interest. No craft
	plied up and down the river; there were no
	bridges from shore to shore; there were none of
	those scattered and half-squalid habitations which
	generally are found on the outskirts of a city;
	there came to us no distant sound of bells; and
	not the smallest wreath of smoke rose from any
	of the buildings.</p>

	<p>In answer to our inquiries our landlord told
	us that the city over the river had been built by
	one man, who was a visionary, and who had a
	great deal more money than common sense.
	&#8220;It is not as big a town as you would think,
	sirs,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because the general mistiness of
	things in this valley makes them look larger than
	they are. Those hills, for instance, when you get
	to them are not as high as they look to be from
	here. But the town is big enough, and a good
	deal too big; for it ruined its builder and owner,
	who when he came to die had not money enough
	left to put up a decent tombstone at the head of
	his grave. He had a queer idea that he would
	like to have his town all finished before anybody
	lived in it, and so he kept on working and spending
	<a class="pagenum" id="page221" title="221">&nbsp;</a>money year after year and year after year
	until the city was done and he had not a cent left.
	During all the time that the place was building
	hundreds of people came to him to buy houses,
	or to hire them, but he would not listen to anything
	of the kind. No one must live in his town
	until it was all done. Even his workmen were
	obliged to go away at night to lodge. It is a
	town, sirs, I am told, in which nobody has slept
	for even a night. There are streets there, and
	places of business, and churches, and public
	halls, and everything that a town full of inhabitants
	could need; but it is all empty and
	deserted, and has been so as far back as I can
	remember, and I came to this region when I
	was a little boy.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And is there no one to guard the place?&#8221; we
	asked; &#8220;no one to protect it from wandering
	vagrants who might choose to take possession of
	the buildings?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;There are not many vagrants in this part of
	the country,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and if there were they
	would not go over to that city. It is haunted.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;By what?&#8221; we asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, sirs, I scarcely can tell you; queer beings
	that are not flesh and blood, and that is all I
	know about it. A good many people living hereabouts
	have visited that place once in their lives,
	but I know of no one who has gone there a
	second time.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page222" title="222">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;And travellers,&#8221; I said, &#8220;are they not excited
	by curiosity to explore that strange uninhabited
	city?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; our host replied; &#8220;almost all
	visitors to the valley go over to that queer city&#8212;generally
	in small parties, for it is not a place
	in which one wishes to walk about alone. Sometimes
	they see things and sometimes they don&#8217;t.
	But I never knew any man or woman to show a
	fancy for living there, although it is a very good
	town.&#8221;</p>

	<p>This was said at supper-time, and, as it was
	the period of full moon, Bentley and I decided
	that we would visit the haunted city that evening.
	Our host endeavored to dissuade us, saying that
	no one ever went over there at night; but as we
	were not to be deterred he told us where we
	would find his small boat tied to a stake on the
	river-bank. We soon crossed the river, and
	landed at a broad but low stone pier, at the land
	end of which a line of tall grasses waved in the
	gentle night wind as if they were sentinels warning
	us from entering the silent city. We pushed
	through these, and walked up a street fairly
	wide, and so well paved that we noticed none of
	the weeds and other growths which generally denote
	desertion or little use. By the bright light
	of the moon we could see that the architecture
	was simple, and of a character highly gratifying
	to the eye. All the buildings were of stone, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page223" title="223">&nbsp;</a>of good size. We were greatly excited and interested,
	and proposed to continue our walks
	until the moon should set, and to return on the
	following morning&#8212;&#8220;to live here, perhaps,&#8221;
	said Bentley. &#8220;What could be so romantic and
	yet so real? What could conduce better to the
	marriage of verse and philosophy?&#8221; But as he
	said this we saw around the corner of a cross-street
	some forms as of people hurrying away.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The spectres,&#8221; said my companion, laying his
	hand on my arm.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Vagrants, more likely,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;who
	have taken advantage of the superstition of the
	region to appropriate this comfort and beauty to
	themselves.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;If that be so,&#8221; said Bentley, &#8220;we must have
	a care for our lives.&#8221;</p>

	<p>We proceeded cautiously, and soon saw other
	forms fleeing before us and disappearing, as we
	supposed, around corners and into houses. And
	now suddenly finding ourselves upon the edge of
	a wide, open public square, we saw in the dim
	light&#8212;for a tall steeple obscured the moon&#8212;the
	forms of vehicles, horses, and men moving here
	and there. But before, in our astonishment, we
	could say a word one to the other, the moon
	moved past the steeple, and in its bright light we
	could see none of the signs of life and traffic
	which had just astonished us.</p>

	<p>Timidly, with hearts beating fast, but with not
	<a class="pagenum" id="page224" title="224">&nbsp;</a>one thought of turning back, nor any fear of
	vagrants&#8212;for we were now sure that what we
	had seen was not flesh and blood, and therefore
	harmless&#8212;we crossed the open space and entered
	a street down which the moon shone clearly.
	Here and there we saw dim figures, which
	quickly disappeared; but, approaching a low
	stone balcony in front of one of the houses, we
	were surprised to see, sitting thereon and leaning
	over a book which lay open upon the top of the
	carved parapet, the figure of a woman who did
	not appear to notice us.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That is a real person,&#8221; whispered Bentley,
	&#8220;and she does not see us.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I replied; &#8220;it is like the others. Let
	us go near it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>We drew near to the balcony and stood before
	it. At this the figure raised its head and looked
	at us. It was beautiful, it was young; but its
	substance seemed to be of an ethereal quality
	which we had never seen or known of. With
	its full, soft eyes fixed upon us, it spoke.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why are you here?&#8221; it asked. &#8220;I have said
	to myself that the next time I saw any of you I
	would ask you why you come to trouble us.
	Cannot you live content in your own realms and
	spheres, knowing, as you must know, how timid
	we are, and how you frighten us and make us unhappy?
	In all this city there is, I believe, not
	one of us except myself who does not flee and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page225" title="225">&nbsp;</a>hide from you whenever you cruelly come here.
	Even I would do that, had not I declared to myself
	that I would see you and speak to you,
	and endeavor to prevail upon you to leave us in
	peace.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The clear, frank tones of the speaker gave
	me courage. &#8220;We are two men,&#8221; I answered,
	&#8220;strangers in this region, and living for the
	time in the beautiful country on the other side of
	the river. Having heard of this quiet city, we
	have come to see it for ourselves. We had supposed
	it to be uninhabited, but now that we find
	that this is not the case, we would assure you
	from our hearts that we do not wish to disturb or
	annoy any one who lives here. We simply came
	as honest travellers to view the city.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The figure now seated herself again, and as her
	countenance was nearer to us, we could see that it
	was filled with pensive thought. For a moment
	she looked at us without speaking. &#8220;Men!&#8221; she
	said. &#8220;And so I have been right. For a long
	time I have believed that the beings who sometimes
	come here, filling us with dread and awe,
	are men.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And you,&#8221; I exclaimed&#8212;&#8220;who are you,
	and who are these forms that we have seen,
	these strange inhabitants of this city?&#8221;</p>

	<p>She gently smiled as she answered, &#8220;We are
	the ghosts of the future. We are the people who
	are to live in this city generations hence. But all
	<a class="pagenum" id="page226" title="226">&nbsp;</a>of us do not know that, principally because we do
	not think about it and study about it enough to
	know it. And it is generally believed that the
	men and women who sometimes come here are
	ghosts who haunt the place.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And that is why you are terrified and flee
	from us?&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;You think we are
	ghosts from another world?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;that is what is thought,
	and what I used to think.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And you,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;are spirits of human
	beings yet to be?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;but not for a long
	time. Generations of men&#8212;I know not how
	many&#8212;must pass away before we are men and
	women.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; exclaimed Bentley, clasping his
	hands and raising his eyes to the sky, &#8220;I shall
	be a spirit before you are a woman.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she said again, with a sweet smile
	upon her face, &#8220;you may live to be very, very
	old.&#8221;</p>

	<p>But Bentley shook his head. This did not
	console him. For some minutes I stood in contemplation,
	gazing upon the stone pavement beneath
	my feet. &#8220;And this,&#8221; I ejaculated, &#8220;is a
	city inhabited by the ghosts of the future, who
	believe men and women to be phantoms and
	spectres?&#8221;</p>

	<p>She bowed her head.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page227" title="227">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;But how is it,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;that you discovered
	that you are spirits and we mortal men?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;There are so few of us who think of such
	things,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;so few who study,
	ponder, and reflect. I am fond of study, and I
	love philosophy; and from the reading of many
	books I have learned much. From the book
	which I have here I have learned most; and
	from its teachings I have gradually come to the
	belief, which you tell me is the true one, that we
	are spirits and you men.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And what book is that?&#8221; I asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is &#8216;The Philosophy of Relative Existences,&#8217;
	by Rupert Vance.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ye gods!&#8221; I exclaimed, springing upon the
	balcony, &#8220;that is my book, and I am Rupert
	Vance.&#8221; I stepped toward the volume to seize
	it, but she raised her hand.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You cannot touch it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is the
	ghost of a book. And did you write it?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Write it? No,&#8221; I said; &#8220;I am writing it.
	It is not yet finished.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But here it is,&#8221; she said, turning over the
	last pages. &#8220;As a spirit book it is finished. It
	is very successful; it is held in high estimation
	by intelligent thinkers; it is a standard
	work.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I stood trembling with emotion. &#8220;High estimation!&#8221;
	I said. &#8220;A standard work!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; she replied, with animation; &#8220;and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page228" title="228">&nbsp;</a>it well deserves its great success, especially in its
	conclusion. I have read it twice.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But let me see these concluding pages,&#8221; I
	exclaimed. &#8220;Let me look upon what I am to
	write.&#8221;</p>

	<p>She smiled, and shook her head, and closed
	the book. &#8220;I would like to do that,&#8221; she said,
	&#8220;but if you are really a man you must not know
	what you are going to do.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, tell me, tell me,&#8221; cried Bentley from
	below, &#8220;do you know a book called &#8216;Stellar
	Studies,&#8217; by Arthur Bentley? It is a book of
	poems.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The figure gazed at him. &#8220;No,&#8221; it said,
	presently, &#8220;I never heard of it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I stood trembling. Had the youthful figure
	before me been flesh and blood, had the book
	been a real one, I would have torn it from her.</p>

	<p>&#8220;O wise and lovely being!&#8221; I exclaimed, falling
	on my knees before her, &#8220;be also benign and
	generous. Let me but see the last page of my
	book. If I have been of benefit to your world;
	more than all, if I have been of benefit to you, let
	me see, I implore you&#8212;let me see how it is that
	I have done it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>She rose with the book in her hand. &#8220;You
	have only to wait until you have done it,&#8221; she
	said, &#8220;and then you will know all that you could
	see here.&#8221; I started to my feet and stood alone
	upon the balcony.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page229" title="229">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said Bentley, as we walked toward
	the pier where we had left our boat, &#8220;that
	we talked only to that ghost girl, and that the
	other spirits were all afraid of us. Persons
	whose souls are choked up with philosophy are
	not apt to care much for poetry; and even if my
	book is to be widely known, it is easy to see that
	she may not have heard of it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I walked triumphant. The moon, almost touching
	the horizon, beamed like red gold. &#8220;My dear
	friend,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I have always told you that you
	should put more philosophy into your poetry.
	That would make it live.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And I have always told you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that
	you should not put so much poetry into your
	philosophy. It misleads people.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t mislead that ghost girl,&#8221; said I.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; said Bentley. &#8220;Perhaps
	she is wrong, and the other inhabitants of
	the city are right, and we may be the ghosts after
	all. Such things, you know, are only relative.
	Anyway,&#8221; he continued, after a little pause, &#8220;I
	wish I knew that those ghosts were now reading
	the poem which I am going to begin to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

	<h2 class="story_title"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page233" title="233">&nbsp;</a>A PIECE OF RED CALICO</h2>

	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">I was</span> going into town one morning
	from my suburban residence, when my
	wife handed me a little piece of red
	calico, and asked me if I would have
	time, during the day, to buy her two yards and a
	half of calico like that. I assured her that it
	would be no trouble at all; and putting the sample
	in my pocket, I took the train for the city.</p>

	<p>At lunch-time I stopped in at a large dry-goods
	store to attend to my wife&#8217;s commission. I saw
	a well-dressed man walking the floor between the
	counters, where long lines of girls were waiting
	on much longer lines of customers, and asked him
	where I could see some red calico.</p>

	<p>&#8220;This way, sir.&#8221; And he led me up the store.
	&#8220;Miss Stone,&#8221; said he to a young lady, &#8220;show
	this gentleman some red calico.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What shade do you want?&#8221; asked Miss
	Stone.</p>

	<p>I showed her the little piece of calico that my
	wife had given me. She looked at it and handed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page234" title="234">&nbsp;</a>it back to me. Then she took down a great roll
	of red calico and spread it out on the counter.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, that isn&#8217;t the shade!&#8221; said I.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, not exactly,&#8221; said she; &#8220;but it is prettier
	than your sample.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; said I; &#8220;but, you see, I want
	to match this piece. There is something already
	made of this kind of calico which needs to be enlarged
	or mended or something. I want some
	calico of the same shade.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The girl made no answer, but took down another
	roll.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the shade,&#8221; said she.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;but it&#8217;s striped.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Stripes are more worn than anything else in
	calicoes,&#8221; said she.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, but this isn&#8217;t to be worn. It&#8217;s for furniture,
	I think. At any rate, I want perfectly plain
	stuff, to match something already in use.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think you can find it perfectly
	plain unless you get Turkey red.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What is Turkey red?&#8221; I asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Turkey red is perfectly plain in calicoes,&#8221; she
	answered.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, let me see some.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t any Turkey-red calico left,&#8221; she
	said, &#8220;but we have some very nice plain calicoes
	in other colors.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any other color. I want stuff
	to match this.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page235" title="235">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to match cheap calico like that,&#8221; she
	said. And so I left her.</p>

	<p>I next went into a store a few doors farther
	up the street. When I entered I approached the
	&#8220;floor-walker,&#8221; and handing him my sample,
	said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Have you any calico like this?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Third counter to the
	right.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I went to the third counter to the right, and
	showed my sample to the salesman in attendance
	there. He looked at it on both sides. Then he
	said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t any of this.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I was told you had,&#8221; said I.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We had it, but we&#8217;re out of it now. You&#8217;ll
	get that goods at an upholsterer&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I went across the street to an upholsterer&#8217;s.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Have you any stuff like this?&#8221; I asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the salesman, &#8220;we haven&#8217;t. Is it
	for furniture?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I replied.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then Turkey red is what you want.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Is Turkey red just like this?&#8221; I asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but it&#8217;s much better.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That makes no difference to me,&#8221; I replied.
	&#8220;I want something just like this.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But they don&#8217;t use that for furniture,&#8221; he
	said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I should think people could use anything
	<a class="pagenum" id="page236" title="236">&nbsp;</a>they wanted for furniture,&#8221; I remarked, somewhat
	sharply.</p>

	<p>&#8220;They can, but they don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said, quite
	calmly. &#8220;They don&#8217;t use red like that. They
	use Turkey red.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I said no more, but left. The next place I
	visited was a very large dry-goods store. Of the
	first salesman I saw I inquired if they kept red
	calico like my sample.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find that on the second story,&#8221; said
	he.</p>

	<p>I went upstairs. There I asked a man:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Where will I find red calico?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;In the far room to the left. Over there.&#8221;
	And he pointed to a distant corner.</p>

	<p>I walked through the crowds of purchasers and
	salespeople, and around the counters and tables
	filled with goods, to the far room to the left.
	When I got there I asked for red calico.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The second counter down this side,&#8221; said the
	man.</p>

	<p>I went there and produced my sample. &#8220;Calicoes
	downstairs,&#8221; said the man.</p>

	<p>&#8220;They told me they were up here,&#8221; I said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Not these plain goods. You&#8217;ll find &#8217;em
	downstairs at the back of the store, over on that
	side.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I went downstairs to the back of the store.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Where will I find red calico like this?&#8221; I
	asked.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page237" title="237">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Next counter but one,&#8221; said the man addressed,
	walking with me in the direction pointed
	out.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Dunn, show red calicoes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Mr. Dunn took my sample and looked at it.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t this shade in that quality of
	goods,&#8221; he said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, have you it in any quality of goods?&#8221;
	I asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes; we&#8217;ve got it finer.&#8221; And he took down
	a piece of calico, and unrolled a yard or two of it
	on the counter.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not this shade,&#8221; I said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The goods is finer and the
	color&#8217;s better.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I want it to match this,&#8221; I said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I thought you weren&#8217;t particular about the
	match,&#8221; said the salesman. &#8220;You said you
	didn&#8217;t care for the quality of the goods, and you
	know you can&#8217;t match goods without you take
	into consideration quality and color both. If you
	want that quality of goods in red, you ought to
	get Turkey red.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I did not think it necessary to answer this
	remark, but said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve got nothing to match this?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, sir. But perhaps they may have it in the
	upholstery department, in the sixth story.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So I got in the elevator and went up to the top
	of the house.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page238" title="238">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Have you any red stuff like this?&#8221; I said to
	a young man.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Red stuff? Upholstery department&#8212;other
	end of this floor.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I went to the other end of the floor.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I want some red calico,&#8221; I said to a man.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Furniture goods?&#8221; he asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said I.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Fourth counter to the left.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I went to the fourth counter to the left, and
	showed my sample to a salesman. He looked at
	it, and said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get this down on the first floor&#8212;calico
	department.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I turned on my heel, descended in the elevator,
	and went out on the street. I was thoroughly
	sick of red calico. But I determined to make
	one more trial. My wife had bought her red
	calico not long before, and there must be some
	to be had somewhere. I ought to have asked her
	where she obtained it, but I thought a simple little
	thing like that could be bought anywhere.</p>

	<p>I went into another large dry-goods store. As
	I entered the door a sudden tremor seized me. I
	could not bear to take out that piece of red calico.
	If I had had any other kind of a rag about me&#8212;a
	pen-wiper or anything of the sort&#8212;I think I
	would have asked them if they could match that.</p>

	<p>But I stepped up to a young woman and presented
	my sample, with the usual question.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page239" title="239">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Back room, counter on the left,&#8221; she said.</p>

	<p>I went there.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Have you any red calico like this?&#8221; I asked
	of the saleswoman behind the counter.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but we have it in Turkey
	red.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Turkey red again! I surrendered.</p>

	<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; I said, &#8220;give me Turkey red.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;How much, sir?&#8221; she asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8212;say five yards.&#8221;</p>

	<p>She looked at me rather strangely, but measured
	off five yards of Turkey-red calico. Then
	she rapped on the counter and called out &#8220;Cash!&#8221;
	A little girl, with yellow hair in two long plaits,
	came slowly up. The lady wrote the number of
	yards, the name of the goods, her own number,
	the price, the amount of the bank-note I handed
	her, and some other matters, probably the color
	of my eyes and the direction and velocity of the
	wind, on a slip of paper. She then copied all
	this into a little book which she kept by her.
	Then she handed the slip of paper, the money,
	and the Turkey red to the yellow-haired girl.
	This young person copied the slip into a little
	book she carried, and then she went away with
	the calico, the paper slip, and the money.</p>

	<p>After a very long time&#8212;during which the little
	girl probably took the goods, the money, and the
	slip to some central desk, where the note was received,
	its amount and number entered in a book,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page240" title="240">&nbsp;</a>change given to the girl, a copy of the slip made
	and entered, girl&#8217;s entry examined and approved,
	goods wrapped up, girl registered, plaits counted
	and entered on a slip of paper and copied by the
	girl in her book, girl taken to a hydrant and
	washed, number of towel entered on a paper slip
	and copied by the girl in her book, value of my
	note and amount of change branded somewhere
	on the child, and said process noted on a slip of
	paper and copied in her book&#8212;the girl came to
	me, bringing my change and the package of
	Turkey-red calico.</p>

	<p>I had time for but very little work at the office
	that afternoon, and when I reached home I handed
	the package of calico to my wife. She unrolled
	it and exclaimed:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, this don&#8217;t match the piece I gave you!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Match it!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Oh no! it don&#8217;t
	match it. You didn&#8217;t want that matched. You
	were mistaken. What you wanted was Turkey
	red&#8212;third counter to the left. I mean, Turkey
	red is what they use.&#8221;</p>

	<p>My wife looked at me in amazement, and then
	I detailed to her my troubles.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said she, &#8220;this Turkey red is a great
	deal prettier than what I had, and you&#8217;ve got so
	much of it that I needn&#8217;t use the other at all. I
	wish I had thought of Turkey red before.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I wish from the bottom of my heart you
	had,&#8221; said I.</p>
